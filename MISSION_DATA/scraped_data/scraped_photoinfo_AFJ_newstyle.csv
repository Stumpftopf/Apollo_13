Pyrotechnic isolation valves are used to open the piping that will transport the propellant, the oxidizer, and the Helium used to pressurize the system. This way, all three will remain contained until they are required to be used, and are hence protected against the hardships of the launch and the translunar coast.

The small explosive device createst a burst of mechanical energy which is used to drive a piston through the closed off propellant and helium lines. It shears the closure and puts the piston port into place, which allows the liquids and gasses to pass through into the system.

It supplies oxygen for approximately 30 minutes, allowing an astronaut with a malfunctioning PLSS backpack to return to the LM.

To charge the battery A for now, they need to set up the circuit breakers and switches so that electric current may flow from the LM Umbilical to DC MAIN BUS B. From, there, the LM battery current is connected to the battery charger through Main Bus B for the DC power, and to one of the inverters to supply AC power to the charger. The battery A itself is connected to the system through the Battery Bus. The charge procedure is normal besides the source of the electric power coming into the charger, which would normally be supplied by the fuel cells.
