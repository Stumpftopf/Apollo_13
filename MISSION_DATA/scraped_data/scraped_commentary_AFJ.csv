|The Saturn V launch vehicle is assembled, transported on, and launched from the Mobile Launcher. This structure consists of a base platform 48.8 x 41.1 metres and 7.6 metres high with a 13.7 metre square hole over which the vehicle is mounted. (The platforms were later converted for use by the Space Shuttle.) Sprouting from one end of this platform is the LUT (Launch Umbilical Tower). This 116 metre tower bears nine swing arms which provide the ground crew with access points to the vehicle, and a wide range of services including fuel, LOX, hydraulics, electrical power and various gases for purging and pressurization. These arms are articulated so they can swing away from the vehicle to give it clearance as it rises, and to protect them from the rocket's white hot exhaust gases. The crew enter the spacecraft via the top, or ninth, arm, which carries an environmentally controlled room at its end. Known as the "white room", it covers the CM hatch until the crew is aboard. 43 minutes before launch, it is swung away from the spacecraft by 12°. Five minutes before launch, it completes its retraction to 180°, on the opposite side of the tower from the Saturn V.

|The launch pad sits several miles away from the space center. The enormous concrete wedge is surrounded by empty space, some small support buildings, and the facilities for holding the rocket fuel before loading it into the Saturn V itself. The launch pad itself isn't a solid block of concrete, but contains maintenance spaces, connections for the piping and electric power sources needed by the Mobile Launcher - and even an emergency bunker for any staff that will not have the time to reach other safety in time.

|Apollo 13 is the third attempt by the United States to perform a manned landing on the Moon. The mission's destination, in the highlands near the crater Fra Mauro, reflects the Apollo programme's increasing emphasis on science. Two of the crew, commander Jim Lovell and Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise, plan to bring their Lunar Module <i>Aquarius</i> down to a precision landing near a 370-metre crater called Cone. This crater acts like a drillhole, the physics of its formation allowing subsurface material to be sampled around its rim and, hopefully, giving insight into the Moon's geological history. One week before launch, the third crewmember, Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert, was on the backup crew when prime CMP Ken Mattingly was exposed to German measles. Mattingly did not have immunity to the disease so to avoid the possibility of him becoming sick during the mission, he was replaced by his backup only two days before launch.
|The launch day is Saturday, April 11th, 1970. The planned time of launch is 19:13:00 GMT which, at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), will be 14:13:00 EST. The launch azimuth, in other words the heading that the vehicle's ground track will take away from the launch pad, is 72&deg; or about east-northeast.
|Apollo 13 will be launched in the April launch window to the Moon. The launch window for the chosen day, April 11th, opens at 14:13:00 EST which is exactly the planned moment of their launch. It will remain open until 17:37:00 EST. Should 13 fail to launch in April, backup dates are set in May, with three days from 9th to the 11th of May as launch opportunities.
|A launch window is a time determined to be optimal for the launch of a space vehicle so that it can reach its destination, given certain constraints, of which Apollo has many. A daytime launch is preferred, since it would aid in crew recovery should they need to abort during the launch. The launch trajectory azimuth restriction from 72&deg; to 108&deg; dictates this time as well. It is desirable to perform the translunar injection burn over the Pacific Ocean for communication reasons. The landing should occur when sunlight conditions on the surface of the Moon are favorable for the crew to view their landing site. A very large antenna capable of tracking the lunar landing is located in Goldstone, California and it would be preferable to time the landing so that this antenna is pointing at the Moon at the time, which adds its own limitation. Finally, daytime conditions for the primary recovery area during their scheduled return are needed, for safe recovery of the crew after they splash down.
|Launch operations will be conducted in a standard manner, familiar from previous Apollo launches. However, special attention is being paid to weather conditions due to the lightning strike incident during the launch of Apollo 12. Great care has been taken to ensure that the launch will not take place should the weather suggest the possibility of thunder or triggering lightning by flying the Saturn V into it.
|The Apollo 13 space vehicle, consisting of the mighty Saturn V launch vehicle and the Apollo 13 spacecraft, has awaited launch at Pad 39A since December 15, 1969, when the Mobile Launcher carried it from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to the launch site.
|As the transcript starts, the Saturn V is already fully fueled. Only relatively small amounts are being pumped into the tanks to continue topping them off to compensate for the boil-off of extremely volatile cryogenic propellants. This ensures that the tanks contain the expected quantity of liquid at launch. The first stage, the S-IC, is loaded with 815,113 liters of RP-1 kerosene fuel, along with 1,318,621 liters of liquid oxygen (LOX) oxidizer. The thirst of the first stage engines is truly astronomical. The contents of the first stage liquid oxygen tank alone compose one half of the total weight of the Saturn V stack. In comparison, the propellant levels in the other two stages sound tiny. The S-II second stage carries 1,030,919 liters of liquid hydrogen (LH<sub>2</sub>) fuel and 333,930 liters of liquid oxygen. The similarly liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen-fueled third stage carries 242,815 liters and 76,571 liters respectively.
|This fully fueled Apollo/Saturn V is the heaviest space vehicle yet. Its mass stands at 2,949,136 kilograms, or 6,501,733 pounds. The first stage engines must overcome this weight to lift the Saturn V vehicle off the pad and head it to space. Only 1.5 per cent of all this mass consists of the crew and its two spacecraft stacked one on top of another - and even then, most of that remaining 1.5 per cent is the fuel loaded in the Service Module and the two-stage Lunar Module!
|After being woken up, the astronauts enjoyed a small banquet of sorts before the launch, a breakfast of steak and eggs with coffee, treats they would not be getting while in space. The menu is chosen to have a low residue and according to the public affairs announcer, consists of steak and eggs, orange juice, coffee, jelly and toast.
|After getting dressed in their Constant Wear Garment (CWG) underwear and medical sensors, the crewmembers moved into the suiting up area at the crew quarters to begin the cumbersome process of getting inside their handmade, made to fit A7L spacesuits - each offically known as an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). The A7L provides them with a pressurized environment and protection against extreme cold, heat and vacuum, as well as radiation and micrometeroids.
|Jim is all geared up on his lunar surface suit, topping off weight at 19.69 kilograms or 43.42 pounds. Pockets on his spacesuit are filled with equipment ranging from radiation dosimeters to pencils to checklists - to a sandwich for a post-launch snack.
|After suiting up, the crew is taken to the launch pad aboard a vehicle, usually dubbed the Astro Van. They are hooked up to suitcase-like portable oxygen supplies (known as ventilators) for the trip until their hoses are connected to the spacecraft's Environmental Control System feeds. This is part of the prebreathing sequence to condition the crew to a 100 per cent oxygen atmosphere, which they will be breathing throughout the mission. Breathing pure oxygen flushes out the nitrogen that is normally part of our breathing air. Should they still have nitrogen in their bloodstream as the pressure onboard the spacecraft drops during ascent, they could suffer from dysbarism - also known as the bends, where bubbles of nitrogen form and cause a painful, debilitating and potentially fatal condition in the human body.
|The White Room sits on the end of the topmost service arm on the launch tower. It serves as a place for the crew to enter the spacecraft, and for technicians to perform any final necessary checks and maintenance.
|Part of the ritual of boarding the spacecraft was the exchange of gag gifts to break the pre-flight tension. For Apollo 13, Pad Leader Guenther Wendt recalls giving Fred a baby doll and some diapers to practice changing, for his upcoming baby.
|The crew slips through the side hatch of the spacecraft and then onto the crew couches. The commander, Jim Lovell, boards first and takes the left couch, followed by Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise to the right hand one, and Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert taking the middle seat. The commander and the Command Module Pilot will later swap positions to give the Jack better access to the controls and the windows for the upcoming docking maneuvers. Whoever sits on the middle seat is practically blind to what happens outside.
|In the operations manual, the boarding of the crew into the Command Module is known as Crew Ingress. In the Saturn V manual for the launch operations, it is known as crew loading - an interesting difference in philosophy, but not entirely untrue. They are meant to be passengers for the duration of the activity of the Saturn V.
|Once onboard the spacecraft, the crewmen are plugged into the communications system via cables, and have their oxygen hoses connected from the portable tanks into receptacles on the left hand side of the cabin. The Lunar Module Pilot needs longer hoses for them to reach the connectors on the other side of the cabin.
|The spacesuits have their own internal ventilation ducting to move air throughout the suit. This aids cooling, moisture control and makes sure that the oxygen from the system is evenly distributed and flows to the crewmember's face.
|For the launch period, once the hatch is closed, the Command Module is pressurized with a mixture of 60 per cent oxygen and 40 per cent nitrogen. This is a safety measure against the likes of the fire that devastated Apollo 1 in the pad fire due to a spark that ignited the 100-per-cent oxygen atmosphere. The crew is isolated from this atmosphere within their space suits. During the ascent, the cabin will be allowed to vent as the outside pressure falls and a high flow of oxygen will be fed into the cabin to remove the remaining nitrogen and create the 100-per-cent atmosphere to be used for the remainder of the mission. By this time, the cabin pressure will have fallen to just over one third of sea-level pressure.
|Although 100-per-cent oxygen carries the risk of increased fire hazard, it has some virtues that make it preferable for use on the Apollo system. Having a single gas atmospheric system reduces its complexity, hence makes it more reliable and lightweight by elimiating the need for multiple sets of pressure regulators and tankage, for example. Having five times the normal amount of oxygen in the breathable air also means that a much lower pressure is used, which puts less strain on the hull of the spacecraft.
|Multiple recordings of the mission's audio are available. The most commonly available version is the Public Affairs Office (PAO) feed which carries the air-ground conversation punctuated by explanatory comments from a PAO announcer either at KSC or in Mission Control, Houston. A recording of the direct spacecraft communications for Apollo 13 includes a period of 91 minutes prior to launch when the crew were working with the Launch Vehicle Test Conductor Jack Baltar and the Spacecraft Test Conductor Skip Chauvin to ensure that the Command Service Module (CSM), known as <i>Odyssey</i>, is ready for the flight. Unfortunately, this latter recording only carries the spacecraft side of the conversation. With the available documentation, however, it is possible to reconstruct the crew activities during this period based on their comments.
|We join the crew moments after they have entered the Command Module. It is an hour and a half to lift-off and the three-man crew is busy at work, performing their final checks of the onboard systems.
|The final checkout sequence starts at approximately T-01:40:00 with the side hatch closing.
|The side hatch has a complicated locking mechanism that can be operated from the inside and the outside. It was one of the key components of the Apollo Command Module changed after the Apollo 1 pad fire. A nitrogen-powered counterbalance system helps the hatch be quickly opened in seconds, if needed.
-01:30:08|The Boost Protective Cover shields the Command Module during the initial phase of the launch, up until about 3 minutes into the flight, or when the Launch Escape System is jettisoned and the BPC along with it. The main purposes are to protect the Command Module windows as well as the primary thermal protective system composed of the forward heatshield and the Kapton plastic film that covers the entire skin of the Command Module and provides thermal control assistance while in open space. This saved weight on the actual spacecraft, by eliminating the need for a more heavy thermal protection system. The BPC is composed of a rigid top section made out of fibreglass and a cork-based ablative material, while the bottom part is composed of fibreglass cloth covered in the same cork ablative material. In this context, ablative means that as the material becomes charred, it transfers heat away instead of allowing the spacecraft underneath it suffer from the high temperatures.
-01:24:56|They are likely checking the pressure difference between the oxygen circulating in their suits and in the cabin. The pressure is kept higher in the suit circuit to avoid the oxygen/nitrogen mixture in the cabin leaking into their suits.
-01:22:56|These circuit breakers supply power to the EDS - Emergency Detection System, and the ELS, or Earth Landing System. Both need to be powered up for the ascent so that the first can detect excessive attitude changes during atmospheric flight, and in case of a catastrophic failure of the launch vehicle, so that the second system will ensure a safe splashdown of the Command Module in the Atlantic Ocean.
-01:22:37|The computer in the Instrument Unit can have some of its programming remotely updated via a radio link. This switch selection inhibits that for the moment.
-01:22:37|The ascent of the Saturn V-Apollo stack is not controlled from the spacecraft but instead from within the booster. A 1-meter-tall segment sits on the top of the S-IVB third stage of the booster and contains its own independent guidance and control systems used for the first phase of the mission.
-01:22:37|The Instrument Unit, or IU, is built by IBM. At its core are the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) that will perform all the necessary control functions during ascent, and the ST-124 inertial platform capable of sensing changes in their attitude and acceleration.
-01:22:37|The equipment installed into the Instrument Unit turns the Saturn V into what can be considered a third spacecraft in the Saturn-V-Apollo stack.
-01:22:37|Directly in front of the three-man crew is the Master Display Console. 419 switches, circuit breakers and dials are accompanied by dozens of gauges, talkbacks and other displays that provide the crew with information about the onboard systems and their status. Some of its switches they use constantly, others are turned into the On position before launch and never touched again. Knowing each of them and their required position is a must, however.
-01:18:51|The instrument known as the Q-ball is positioned on the very tip of the Launch Escape Tower sitting on top of the Command Module. Eight holes in the dome are used to gauge air pressure. During the ascent, they provide information about air resistance, as well as the angle of attack of the vehicle. In an abort situation, this will alarm the EDS to the booster going out of control.
-11:16:22|These are attitude angles as read out from the Flight Director/Attitude Indicator (FDAI). 162&deg; represents a heading of 72&deg; east of north (90 + 72 = 162).
-01:10:04|Although the SPS engine in the Service Module will normally only be used for the first time for a possible course correction after they've been propelled towards the Moon, in case of a high altitude launch abort it can also be used to push the Command Module away from the Saturn V booster and even continue on to achieve orbit.
-00:57:49|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;In comparing this part of the flight preparation with Apollo 8, I can say that it was a lot more comfortable on Apollo 13. On Apollo 8, I was very cold during this period, and I suspect they've changed the Environmental Control System. It was very comfortable this time,&quot;
-00:56:54|Mattingly was indeed in Houston at the time of the launch, not witnessing it from a beach near Cape as depicted in the popular Ron Howard movie.
-00:56:54|Milton Windler is serving as the Lead Flight Director for the first time during Apollo 13. He will also superwise the launch along with his team of flight controllers in Mission Control.
-00:56:54|The Flight Director holds immense power in the Apollo organization when he is on duty. The mission rules stipulate this very clearly. <b>&quot;The Flight Director may, after analysis of the flight, choose to take any necessary action required for the succesful completion of the mission.&quot;</b>
-00:56:54|Flight Directors and their control teams work in shifts, each led by one of the Directors. Four teams were on duty for Apollo 13. They identified themselves with color terms. Milton Windler's Maroon Team was accompanied by Gene Kranz's White Team, Glynn Lunney's Black Team and Gerry Griffin's Gold Team.
-00:56:54|Range safety refers to the self destruct system carried on every element of the Saturn V booster. If a catastrophic failure were to occur and the mission had to be aborted during the launch, then once the Command Module is separated by the automatic Emergency Detection System, a protected radio transmitter will be used to send the secret auto-destruct code into the launch vehicle. This will detonate shaped charges in the propellant tanks to rupture them and disperse their contents and hence prevent a potentially massive explosion upon impact.
-00:42:49|The gear box is on the spacecraft main hatch, which will be latched shut.
-00:41:05|The Pyro Arm switches are such critical controls in terms of safety that they have a locked guard over them up until just before the prime crew enters the cockpit. Turning them to the On position arms the abort system, which they do not want to activate accidentally. The cover is removed with the help of a physical key put into the lock.
-00:40:01|Riding on the very top of the stack is the LES - Launch Escape System. It is a solid-fueled rocket motor which, when activated by an abort command, will fire and pull the Command Module away from a possibly violently exploding Saturn V. Now activated, it can even be used while the stack is still on the launch pad, should there be an emergency where the crew has no time to evacuate the spacecraft.
-00:40:01|The LES was tested several times under simulated abort conditions - and one real abort when an abort test suffered a booster failure and the EDS had to cope with a real emergency - thereby proving the concept.
-00:24:44|This is where they start going down the Boost-Insertion checklist, found in their Launch Checklist. It will provide the crew with operational instructions up until the end of the Translunar Injection phase.
-00:20:29|Jim lists the RCS jets on the four quads around the Service Module, used for fine maneuvers while in space. Switches allow them to select the electric power source for each of them. Half of them are on Main Bus A, the other half on Main Bus B.
-00:20:29|Hypergolic fuels are an elegant solution to many issues rocket engines face, especially those designed to operate for long periods and repeatedly, such as the RCS jets. They ignite on contact with each other, which eliminates the need for a separate ignition system. A thruster merely requires the propellants to be injected into its combustion chamber and it will work. The fuels are also relatively stable in their liquid form, and do not need to be carefully conditioned, such as the very volatile cryogenic propellants used in the Saturn V. In space, the extremely toxic nature of the monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide is also not an issue.
-00:13:28|Jim reads the total attitude of the spacecraft, determined on the three axes of motion. Their roll is calculated at 90 degrees plus their launch azimuth - 72 degrees - resulting in the 162 degrees he reads at the moment. The pitch is 90 degrees, as appropriate - that indicates that they are 'standing' with their nose pointing directly above. Their yaw is zero.
-00:11:14|They perform a series of radio checks, first with Launch Control Operations in Kennedy Space Center, then with the Mission Control Center located in Houston, Texas. Fred addresses Houston as 'Joe', referring to the CapCom, astronaut Joe Kerwin, who is manning that post in the Mission Control Operations Room.
-00:10:47|Network is the Mission Control station responsible for ensuring the working of the MSFN - Manned Spaceflight Network. They are now checking in with the stations covering the Atlantic Ocean, which is the launch path of the Saturn V.
-00:10:41|MILA, or Merritt Island Launch Annex, is the local radio and tracking station at the space center at Cape.
-00:10:37|The next tracking station going east is on the island of Bermuda.
-00:10:34|The tracking ship <i>Vanguard</i> is parked in the Atlantic, to provide radio coverage in an area with no land stations. Despite some earlier technical issues, they are ready to support the mission.
-00:10:32|Moving towards the continent, the next tracking station is at the Canaries Islands off the coast of West Africa.
-00:10:23|Jack has set the Emergency Detection System to Auto mode, which will enable an automatic abort under particular conditions. These would be a launch vehicle structural failure, a dangerous drop in the first stage thrust (usually indicating at least two engines failing) or rates in excess of 4 degrees/second in pitch or yaw and 20 degrees/second in roll. The two conditions besides the structural failure can be manually disabled with switches on the control console.
-00:10:18|This allows the EDS to perform an automatic abort of the mission should the launch vehicle tumble out of control, based on the pre-programmed figures.
-00:10:15|This switch selection allows the EDS to perform an automatic abort should two engines go out during the firing of the S-IC first stage.
-00:10:04|The PAO announcer mentions multiple start tanks in the third stage (the S-IVB). In fact, there is only one. Each J-2 engine has a start tank filled with hydrogen. At engine start, this hydrogen is released through the turbopumps to get them spinning. Since the third stage has only a single J-2, it has one start tank.
-00:09:47|A remarkable operation takes place here. Fred has applied power to the fuel cell reactant valves to make sure that the magnetic solenoid valves are not accidentally shut off by the G forces during the launch.
-00:04:10|Five lights go on in the Main Display Console, to indicate the five engines of the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V.
-00:03:42|Jack is most likely talking about the onboard computer display, where the program indicator should be showing 02 - Program 2. This is a pre-launch program meant to orientate the onboard gyroscopic platform.
-00:03:42|The computer Display and Keyboard (DSKY) holds a central location, positioned so that both the Commander and the Command Module Pilot can operate and observe it. The computer itself physically sits beyond their feet, secured in the lower compartment wall. The computer determines their position and their attitude, calculates trajectories and firings of their main engine or the maneuvering thrusters. The crew communicates with the computer through a numeric keyboard used to input commands in the form of Verbs and Nouns. These linguistic terms are not merely symbolic, but reflect the format of the user interface. The computer displays its information in the form of three five-digit lines, also knows as registers.
-00:03:31|Jack is noting that the computer is displaying Verb 75. Verb 75 is a backup command to be used if the computer does not automatically receive the so-called lift-off discrete, a signal that means they have begun to rise from the pad and for the computer to proceed to Program 11, which it is to run during the ascent. Should they reach the end of the countdown and the computer fails to go to Program 11 automatically, only then will they press ENTER on their computer keyboard to start it up. Program 11's function is to shadow the guidance of the Saturn V. It does not control the vehicle, which is controlled from within the Saturn V's Instrument Unit.
-00:02:52|A high tech tape recorder, utilizing a magnetic tape, will record onboard instrumentation data to be played back to Mission Control later on. It will also record the onboard conversations of the crew on a separate track, which is also similarly accessible.
-00:02:52|High-presure helium is pumped into the tanks from the ground support equipment to begin initial pressurization of the fuel and oxidizer tanks. Once the external connections are sealed off, internal helium tanks will maintain the tank pressurization until engine start. After that, the engines generate gas pressure that is fed via piping into all tanks except the RP-1 tank to pressurize them. The RP-1 tank is pressurised from the onboard helium supply throughout the S-IC's flight.
-00:02:52|Cold gaseous nitrogen is blown into machinery spaces inside each of the three stages of the Saturn V, to condition them.
-00:02:07|Normally, a glycol-water mix is circulated in the cooling system and to radiator panels on the surface of the Service Module. For the launch, however, they take the radiators out of the circuit by pulling a manual lever. The friction between the skin of the spacecraft and the air around them will heat the skin as they ascend, which makes the radiators incapable of cooling.
-00:01:06|Onboard the Command Module, Fred Haise has set the two Main Bus Tie switches to On position. This connects the three Command Module batteries into the Main Buses that are responsible for supplying all electric power to the spacecraft. While the spacecraft draws its power from the onboard fuel cells, the ascent is a high demand situation and the energy stored in the batteries can be used to balance the loads put on the power generation system.
-00:01:06|The batteries will also act as a backup should any problems arise with the Electric Power System during the extremely crucial launch phase. This could be a failure of part of the power distribution system, or one of the fuel cells, for example. This redundancy offered by the batteries was demonstrated dramatically during the launch of Apollo 12 where a lightning strike disabled all the fuel cells, the guidance system and the onboard instrumentation. The batteries being on the line allowed them to troubleshoot their issues and continue onto an entirely successful lunar landing mission.
-00:01:06|Swing arm 1 - or service arm 1 - has been used to top off the S-IC stage with liquid oxygen up until this point.
-00:00:51|Up until this point, the launch vehicle has received external power through the support arms. This is to save battery powered inside the Saturn V to minimize the size of the batteries needed to carry on the rocket, of course.
-00:00:34|The last prescribed action for the crew before the launch is for the Commander to press the GDC Align button on his console. It gives the backup guidance system the numbers that define the spacecraft's attitude as measured by the primary guidance system to ensure that both of them have an identical idea of the vehicle's attitude at launch.
-00:00:34|A certain amount of knowledge about the anatomy of the engine will help to understand its function. A large combustion chamber and bell have an injector plate at the top - not unlike a giant showerhead - through which RP-1 kerosene fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX) are injected at high pressure. Above the injector is the LOX dome which also transmits the force of the thrust from the engine to the rocket's structure. A single-shaft turbopump is mounted beside the combustion chamber. The turbine at the core of the turbopump is at the bottom and is driven by the exhaust gas from burning RP-1 and LOX in a fuel-rich mixture in a gas generator. This way, once started, the engine produces its own operating power. After passing through the turbine, the exhaust gas continues into a heat exchanger, then to a wrap-around exhaust manifold which feeds it into the periphery of the engine bell. The final task for these hot gases is to cool and protect the nozzle extension from the far hotter exhaust of the main engine itself. The nozzle is the visible cone-shaped part of the engine and what people looking at it will probably perceive as the 'real' engine, although the combustion happens above it. The purpose of the nozzle is to direct the extremely hot, energetic gas molecules in the opposite direction to the spacecraft's desired direction - hence generating the actual propulsion. Also above the gas-driven turbine on the same drive shaft is the fuel pump with two inlets from the fuel tank and two outlets going, via shut-off valves, to the injector plate. A line from one of these 'feeds' supplies the gas generator with fuel. Fuel is also used within the engine as a lubricant and as a hydraulic working fluid - This keeps the weight down. Before launch, RJ-1 ramjet fuel is supplied from the ground for this purpose. And then at the top of the turbopump shaft is the LOX pump with a single, large inlet in-line with the turboshaft axis. This pump also has two outlet lines, with valves, to feed the injector plate. One line also supplies LOX to the gas generator. The interior lining of the combustion chamber and engine bell consists of a myriad of pipework through which a large portion of the fuel supply is fed before it goes into the actual combustion chamber to be burnt. This cools the chamber and bell structure while also pre-warming the fuel.
-00:00:34|The last important component to note is an igniter, containing a cartridge of hypergolic fluid with burst diaphragms at either end, and located in the high pressure fuel circuit. It has its own inject point in the combustion chamber. Upon ignition command a mixture of triethylboron with 10-15 per cent triethylaluminium is released into the combustion chamber.
-00:00:34|The function of a hypergolic igniter is rather simple. A great deal of heat is needed to light the RP-1 and LOX propellant that is being pumped into the engine. The mixture of triethylboron and triethylaluminium is hypergolic with oxygen, meaning that once they come in contact with the LOX inside the combustion chamber, they will combust violently. This will provide the starting 'fire' to start the engine properly.
-00:00:34|Every liquid fuel rocket engine on the Saturn V-Apollo stack, except for the F-1 and J-2 engines, employed hypergolic propellants. This was done for the ease of storage and the ensuing reliability of function.
-00:00:34|Of the 110.6-metre height of the entire Apollo 15/Saturn V stack, 42.1 metres comprise the S-IC first stage. Five F-1 engines are clustered at the bottom of the stage to provide 34,025 kN (7,700,000 pounds) of thrust in total. The propellants used are RP-1 (Rocket Propellant-1 or highly refined kerosene) as the fuel and LOX as the oxidiser.
-00:00:34|Guidance Release means that the mechanically suspended inertial guidance unit in the Saturn V's IU Instrument Unit is no longer being held with respect to the rotation of Earth and is now free to begin to sense the spacecraft motion and acceleration.
-00:00:34|Service arm 2 is retracted. It provides power and environmental control to the S-IC stage.
-00:00:34|While the PAO's countdown is heard on the public radio transmission, the crew receives their own countdown from astronaut Paul J. Weitz in Launch Control Center, where he has been monitoring the launch procedures as the 'Stoney' CapCom.
-00:00:34|The ignition sequence of an F-1 engine is a complicated affair with many interrelated events happening almost simultaneously. At T minus 8.9 seconds, a signal from the automatic sequencer fires four pyrotechnic devices. Two initiate combustion within the gas generator while another two cause the fuel-rich turbine exhaust gas to ignite when it enters the engine bell. Electric wire links are deliberately burned away by these igniters to generate an electrical signal to move the start solenoid. The start solenoid directs hydraulic pressure still provided from the ground supply to open the main LOX valves. LOX begins to flow through the LOX pump, starting it to rotate, then into the combustion chamber. The opening of both LOX valves also causes a valve to allow fuel and LOX into the gas generator, where they ignite and accelerate the turbine connected to the gas generator's output. Fuel and LOX pressures rise as the turbine gains speed. The fuel-rich exhaust from the gas generator ignites in the engine bell to prevent backfiring and burping of the engine. The increasing pressure in the fuel lines opens another valve, the igniter fuel valve, letting fuel pressure reach the hypergol cartridge which promptly ruptures. Hypergolic fluid, followed by fuel, enters the chamber through its own ports where it spontaneously ignites on contact with the LOX already in the chamber.
-00:00:34|Rising combustion-induced pressure on the injector plate actuates the ignition monitor valve, directing hydraulic fluid to open the main fuel valves. These are the valves in the fuel lines between the turbopump and the injector plate. The fuel flushes out ethylene glycol which had been preloaded into the cooling pipework around the combustion chamber and nozzle. The heavy load of ethylene glycol mixed with the first injection of fuel slows the build-up of thrust, giving a gentler start. Fluid pressure through calibrated orifices completes the opening of the fuel valves and fuel enters the combustion chamber where it burns in the already flaming gases ignited by the hypergol cartridge. The exact time that the main fuel valves open is sequenced across the five engines to spread the rise in applied force that the structure of the rocket must withstand.
-00:00:34|As fuel and LOX flow increase to maximum, the rise in chamber pressure, and therefore thrust, is monitored to confirm that the required force has been achieved. With the turbopump spinning at full speed, fuel pressure exceeds hydraulic pressure supplied from ground equipment. Check valves switch the engine's hydraulic supply to be fed from the rocket's fuel instead of from the ground.
-00:00:34|0.3 seconds after range time start, the so-called first motion is detected when the Saturn V unseats from the launch pad. This starts the clock, and the mission officially begins.
-00:00:34|Three tail service arms supply connections to the S-IC stage. They are retracted at lift-off.
-00:00:34|Four holddown arms are located on the Mobile Launcher and hold the Saturn V stack in place during assembly, before launch and during lift-off. Each holddown arm can withstand 700,000 pounds of force. During launch, they keep the vehicle steady while the five first stage engines come up to full thrust. The holddown arms are also used to literally hold the launch vehicle back in the sense of not allowing it to simply lurch off the launch pad. A tapered pin system, with a bracket in the holddown arm and a die on the Saturn V, slows the lift-off process for the first six inches of travel, sufficient to maintain the dynamic loads generated by the massive engines within the structural limits of the Saturn V vehicle.
-00:00:34|Five service arms remain connected to the booster up until the point of lift-off. The first motion of the spacecraft triggers the system to separate the service arms, which will then swing back and out of the way.
000:00:01|The lift off is announced by astronaut Paul Weitz from Launch Control.
000:00:01|The moment the clock starts, the mission will begin to follow a carefully arranged schedule known as the <a href="fplan/a13-flightplan-19700316" target="_blank">Flight Plan</a>. This thick 366-page document is the basic 'script' of the mission.
000:00:01|The Flight Plan is divided into six sections. Section I has general notes on the mission and its profile, while Section II lists the mission objectives. Section III, which is of course the thickest one, consists of 192 pages. Most pages cover one hour of flight time, although a 2 hours per page format is used for some quiet periods such as when the crew is asleep. Section IV has various charts on the spacecraft's consumables. Section V is a quick reference to the whole mission timeline, and the small Section VI on the very back has information on backup flight plans should they fail to leave Earth orbit for example, and have to commit to performing a much less glamorous mission.
000:00:01|An annotated sample page of the Flight Plan <a href="pics/FPannotations.png" target="_blank">can be viewed from this link.</a>
000:00:01|The Flight Plan does not contain actual instructions on how to operate the spacecraft. While the Flight Plan might say something like "Perform Stage Separation", the actual operating procedures are usually held in the checklists carried onboard. For time critical phases and complex phases of the mission, cue cards have been made that contain the basic procedures. These can be Velcroed onto the Main Display Console for easy reference without having to look away from the instrumentation.

000:00:02|A digital clock is set to start at lift-off, as well as the Event Timer, which starts counting from a preset time whenever set by the crew. This tells them how long they are into powered flight, and what to expect when all goes according to the plan.
000:00:02|'Commit' means that the launch will now happen, one way or another.
000:00:02|With the liftoff, the all-important crew abort system assumes Mode IA. Should there be a catastrophic failure of the booster during the first 42 seconds of powered flight, this mode will activate either automatically or at a crew command. In a IA abort, the Launch Escape System solid rocket engine will fire while automatic pyrotechnics separate the Command Module from the Service Module. At the same time, a small solid rocket motor known as the Pitch Control Motor will fire sideways to push the Command Module in a downrange direction, away from the trajectory of the Saturn V launch vehicle. RCS propellants in the Command Module are rapidly dumped through vents in the heat shield to protect the parachutes from the toxic chemicals they are comprised of. A few seconds later, a pair of small wings known as canards will snap open on the Launch Escape Tower and are used to modify the airflow around them and turn the Command Module to a suitable attitude for beginning a normal landing sequence, which will lead to splashing down into the Atlantic somewhere off Florida.
000:00:03|Program 11 is known as the Earth Orbit Insertion Monitor. The computer runs Verb 06, Noun 62, which displays their velocity (in ft/s), rate of climb (ft/s) and their current altitude in nautical miles. Note that the computer does not have display capacity for the units nor for the decimal point! The crew had to know what they were looking at, and mentally make such notes.
000:00:03|To make the Program 11 display useful to the crew, a card is provided that contains the expected values for their velocity (V<sub>I</sub>), the rate of climb (known as H-dot) and and their current altitude. This allows them to compare the computer readout to the pre-calculates values on the card and monitor the progress of their ascent.
000:00:03|Notice that V<sub>I</sub> does not start to increment from zero, but instead starts from 1,341 ft/s. This is the velocity that is imparted on the vehicle by the rotation of the Earth itself.
000:00:12|The above picture with the major components of the booster/spacecraft stack labeled <a href="photos/anatomyofSV.jpg" target="_blank">can be viewed from this link.</a>
000:00:16|Now that the Saturn V has cleared the launch tower, responsibility for the mission, and the CapCom duty as well, transfers to Mission Control, Houston.
000:00:16|The stack now rolls around from the 90-degree launch azimuth to the 72-degree azimuth required for their trajectory.
000:00:34|After rising almost vertically, and having rolled to their launch azimuth orientation, they will now begin to slowly pitch over according to a pre-calculated steering program in the Instrument Unit. This will try to minimize the crosswind stresses on the booster.
000:00:44|Mode IB is in place from approximately 42 seconds into the mission up until they reach an altitude of 16.5 nautical miles, or 30.48 kilometers. This is approximately 1 minute, 56 seconds into the mission.
000:00:45|They are at 2,222 metres and moving at 457 metres per second.
000:00:55|As they get higher, the air is becoming thinner, hence the cabin is starting to vent to maintain a pressure difference of about 6 psi or 40kPa between the CM cockpit and the outside atmosphere.
000:01:07|68.4 seconds into the ascent of Saturn V, they reach Mach 1 and break the sound barrier.
000:01:07|In the first 70 seconds, they have climbed 7,593 meters upwards and travelled 1.6 km eastwards onto the Atlantic.
000:01:17|At 81.3 seconds, they reach Maximum Dynamic pressure, or Max Q. This is the moment where the atmospheric resistance of the still thick layer of air is at its highest, working against the ever faster moving launch vehicle-spacecraft stack. It will then start to drop dramatically, as the air gets thinner and hence offers less resistance.
000:01:17|A graph showing the curve of the air resistance vs. their speed while in the atmosphere <a href="pics/maxQgraph.png" target="_blank">can be viewed here.</a>
000:01:50|Besides the FDAI 8-ball and the computer display, several other instruments are used by the commander to monitor their ascent. Lovell just mentioned the readouts of two of them. A gauge to the upper left of the FDAI shows the present g force as experienced. To the right of the FDAI, the indicator lights will warn him of any problem with the launch vehicle or its engines. Below the FDAI, another series of gauges shows the propellant pressures in the Saturn V. Also down there is the LV alpha/SPS Pc indicator. This round dial tells him the current angle of attack - how steeply they are riding up into the air, an important piece of knowledge for any aviator. To have it veer off their predicted value might indicate catastrophic trouble in the launch vehicle.
000:02:01|Mode IC covers the altitude from 16.5 nautical miles (30.48 km) up until the point of Launch Escape Tower jettison. After that they will move on to non-LES aborts.
000:02:07|From now on, the Emergency Detection System will only begin the abort sequence at crew command.
000:02:07|Their current altitude is 31.4 kilometers and rising as they prepare to separate the almost spent first stage.
000:02:16|The center engine has been shut down, to lessen the dynamic stresses on the spacecraft structure from all five enormous engines cutting off simultaneously.
000:02:29|Their current altitude is 55.6 kilometers and rising.
000:02:42|Jim announces their approach to 4 g's around the time that they indeed reach the maximum acceleration experienced during the launch - 3.83 g's. For this to occur at the very end of the first stage burn is natural - it is at this point that the four still burning F-1 engines are pushing a vehicle whose first stage is now nearly empty. Moreover, the reduced atmospheric pressure has raised the efficiency of the engines by about 20 per cent, increasing the thrust of each. by that proportion.
000:02:42|The actually flown acceleration curve deviates from the nominal values - as seen on the graph - due to the unforeseen engine shutdown that will soon happen.
000:02:42|A diagram that illustrates the dramatic curve of the launch vehicle weight during ascent <a href="pics/typicalweight.png" target="_blank">can be viewed here.</a>
000:02:42|Their maximum g comes only a second before the four remaining S-IC engines cut off at 163.60 seconds.
000:02:45|The engine cutoff command is almost immediately followed by other automatic commands being sent to the the various systems onboard the S-IC and S-II stages that are responsible for separating the two booster stages from one another. At 164.1 seconds, four solid-fueled ullage engines are fired in the hollow aluminum ring that joins the first and second stages together. 'Ullage' is a remarkable term that originally referred to winemaking, and the empty space in a barrel. In rocketry, however, it refers to empty space in the fuel tanks and the need to deal with that to ensure that the fuel is pumped properly into the rocket engines. To accomplish this, the S-II stage ullage motors burn for four seconds to force the propellants downwards, and towards the bottom end of the rocket. This way the fuel will reach the fuel pumping system properly.
000:02:45|0.2 seconds after the ullage command, another signal fires eight retro motors in the S-IC stage. The retro units are solid-fueled rockets installed onto the fairings at the very bottom of the stage. Their purpose is to generate a brief burst of thrust in the direction opposite to the rocket's trajectory, meaning that once the two stages separate, the S-IC stage decelerates while the S-II stage continues to move forward. This is done to clear the two stages from one another and to avoid them colliding.
000:02:45|These two videos, kindly donated by Stephen Slater, show the separation of Apollo 4's S-IC stage from its S-II across both planes. They were taken using film cameras mounted on either side of the S-II thrust structure, upper and lower. The cameras were ejected and, having parachuted into the ocean, were located by radio.
000:02:45|Both videos are presented here at 23.976 frames per second, a standard film frame rate. However, they were shot at about 4 times this rate, probably 96 frames per second, to provide a slow motion film for a more useful technical analysis. Therefore, although in real time 30 seconds elapse between each plane separation, the same events in these versions are separated by two minutes.
000:02:45|If the footage looks familiar, you are not wrong. Due to the spectacular nature of this film - originally taken for the much less romantic purpose of evaluating the separation from an engineering point of view - they've made themselves into nearly every documentary on the Apollo program. They are often misattributed to Apollo 11, however, which did not carry such cameras.
000:02:45|An Apollo Flight Journal essay on the onboard cameras <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/camerapods/camerapodessay.html" target="_blank">can be accessed here.</a>
000:02:45|The first stage separation occurred at 36.7 nautical miles, or 68.0 km of altitude. The spent S-IC stage still has an enormous amount of kinetic energy left, and will continue to coast higher to reach an apex altitude of 63.1 nautical miles, or 116.9 km. It is only then that the stage will begin to fall back towards the Earth, into a crash to the Atlantic Ocean some 355 nautical miles (658 km) away from the launch site.
000:02:48|The second, or S-II, stage of Apollo 13's Saturn V vehicle is 24.9 metres tall and is powered by the combustion of LH<sub>2</sub> (liquid hydrogen) and LOX in a cluster of five J-2 rocket motors which generate a total thrust of 5,115kN (1.15 million pounds). A million litres of LH<sub>2</sub>, cooled to -253&deg;C to get it into a liquid state, is loaded into the large, upper tank of the stage while 331,000 litres of LOX is loaded into the smaller, squat tank below. These tanks share a single insulated structure with only an insulated, common bulkhead between them. This was an innovation to save tons of weight in the launch vehicle, enabling a greater payload.
000:02:48|A diagram of the Saturn V's S-II stage <a href="pics/SIIsmall.png" target="_blank">can be viewed here.</a>
000:02:48|The S-II stage carries five J-2 uprated engines which burn LH<sub>2</sub> and LOX to produce up to 1,041 kN (234,000 pounds) thrust each. They are capable of being restarted in flight but this feature is only implemented in the engine used in the S-IVB, having to perform two separate burns during the mission. The S-II stage only needs to be fired once.
000:02:48|The thrust chamber and bell of each engine is fabricated from stainless steel tubes brazed together into a single unit. Supercold LH<sub>2</sub> is pumped through these tubes to cool the thrust chamber and simultaneously prewarm and vapourise the cryogenic fuel. The engine carries two separate turbopumps, both powered in turn by the exhaust from a gas generator which burns the LH<sub>2</sub>/LOX mixture from the propellant tanks. The hot gas exhaust is fed from the gas generator, first to the fuel turbopump, then to the LOX turbopump before being routed to a heat exchanger and finally into the engine bell. The LH<sub>2</sub> fuel and LOX outputs of both turbopumps are fed, via main control valves, to the thrust chamber injector via the LOX dome. Unlike the solid steel and copper injector of the F-1, the J-2 injector is fabricated from layers of stainless steel mesh sintered into a single porous unit. A solid LOX injector behind this carries 614 posts which pass LOX through the injector and into the combustion chamber. Each post has a concentric fuel orifice around it and these orifices are attached to the porous injector. The fuel delivery is arranged to ensure that about 5 per cent of the gaseous hydrogen seeps through the injector face to cool it, the rest passing through the annular orifices and into the chamber.
000:02:48|The ASI (Augmented Spark Igniter), fed with propellant and mounted to the injector face, provides a flame to initiate full combustion. Valves are provided to bleed the cryogenic propellants through the supply system well before ignition to chill all components to their operating temperatures. Otherwise the relatively warmer components would cause gas to be formed which would interfere with the engine's use of propellant as a lubricant in the turbopump bearings.
000:02:48|Attached to the engine is a spherical tank of gaseous helium which is located inside a larger tank of gaseous hydrogen fuel. This is the Start Tank. The high-pressure helium from the tank provides pneumatic operating power for the engine's valves while the high pressure hydrogen spins up the turbopumps before the gas generator is ignited. A PU (Propellant Utilization) valve on the output of the LOX turbopump can open to reduce the LOX flowrate. This adjusts engine thrust down to 890 kN (200,000 pounds) during flight to optimise engine performance. Although this is technically a way to throttle the engine, it is not considered a truly throttleable system.
000:02:48|To start the J-2 engine, spark plugs in the ASI and gas generator are energised. The Helium Control and Ignition Phase valves are actuated electrically. Helium pressure closes the Propellant Bleed valves, it purges the LOX dome and other parts of the engine. The Main Fuel valve and the ASI Oxidiser valves are opened. Flame from the ASI enters the thrust chamber while fuel begins to circulate through its walls under pressure from the fuel tank. After a delay to allow the thrust chamber walls to become conditioned to the chill of the fuel, the Start Tank is discharged through the turbines to spin them up. This delay depends on the role of the engine. A one second delay is used for the S-II engines. Half a second later, the Mainstage Control Solenoid begins the major sequence of the engine start. It opens the control valve of the gas generator where combustion begins and the exhaust supplies power for the turbopumps. The Main Oxidiser valve is opened 14&deg; allowing LOX to begin burning with the fuel which has been circulating through the chamber walls. A valve which has been allowing the gas generator exhaust to bypass the LOX turbopump is closed allowing its turbine to build up to full speed. Finally, the pressure holding the Main Fuel valve at 14&deg; is allowed to bleed away and the valve gradually opens, building the engine up to its rated thrust.
000:03:06|Their altitude is 85.2 kilometers, and they have flown 125.5 km downrange.
000:03:15|Some 30 seconds after the stage separation, another automatic command fires the shaped charge that cuts the interstage off the bottom of the S-II stage. The relatively long interval between staging and the final separation of the interstage is to ensure that it does not collide with the engine bells of the S-II engines.
000:03:15|Should the interstage fail to separate, the launch rules indicate that the mission should be aborted. The 11,450 pounds (5,200 kg) weight would be a prohibitive additional mass to haul along. It would also be possible for the interstage ring to come partially or completely lose while out of control, colliding with the engines and causing devastating damage.
000:03:21|Upon Tower Jett command, a small rocket motor with two exhaust ports fires at the top of the Launch Escape Tower. Pyrotechnics severe the structural and electric connections between the combined tower and Boost Protective Cover structure and the Command Module, allowing the small motor to send it well clear of the vehicle. The discarded equipment will then tumble down into the Atlantic Ocean.
000:03:24|With the Launch Escape Tower gone, Mode II aborts are performed with the Service Module RCS jets or the Service Propulsion System. After separation from the launch vehicle, the Command Module would detach from the Service Module and then begin a landing sequence into the Atlantic Ocean.
000:03:24|At this moment, the Instrument Unit performs a switch to IGM or Iterative Guidance Mode. From now on, the spacecraft guidance system will use the input from its sensors - mainly the inertial platform - to perform changes in trajectory by adjusting engine gimbal pointing to compensate for any errors in their trajectory. These could be caused by air resistance, differences in expected engine performance, for exampple.
000:03:52|Their altitude is now 101 kilometers. This puts them over the <em>Kármán line</em>, the imaginary border between the atmosphere and space as defined by an international convention, and the mark between being an aviator and a space-flown astronaut. The US Air Force definition would put this limit at 80 kilometers, meaning that depending on the definition of space (or your service status!) Fred and Jack could have also entered the exclusive club about 40 seconds earlier. From now on, there's no questioning it.
000:04:30|The S-II stage is lightening rapidly as propellant is burnt, meaning that that engines will be able to propel them faster, with an increasing acceleration.
000:04:31|The S-IC first stage performed slightly better than expected, which might be responsible to their somewhat higher altitude than expected at this point.
000:04:31|In 4&frac12; minutes, they have accelerated to a velocity of 3,352.8 m/s and are now 138.9 kilometers above sea level.
000:04:51|They are 357 kilometers away from the launch site.
000:04:59|They have travelled 402.3 kilometers and climbed to 150 kilometers of altitude.
000:05:32|The PAO is making the call reflexively here, not realizing that something unexpected has indeed happened.
000:05:36|The visual cue for the central engine cut-off is the number 5 light coming on. Readers may recall that in the Ron Howard movie, the lift blinks to show this malfunction state. This is creative license taken by the moviemakers - the lights would either be on, to show an abnormal state, or off, to indicate normal operation.
000:05:36|<b>Dave Scott - Apollo 15 CDR/<i>Apollo 13</i> film technical advisor, from <span class="attribution">1998 correspondence:</span></b> &quot;In Apollo 13, the movie, the light was purposely made to blink to get the viewers' attention - the movie-makers knew the actual operation, but chose to take this license for dramatic effect (actually a pretty good license, as otherwise, the viewer would have missed the point!&quot;
000:05:40|Throughout the program thus far, the S-II stages have been prone to the pogo phenomenon, where interactions between the thrust of the engines, the effectivness of the pumps, and inherent resonances of the propellant ducts and the vehicle's structure lead to longitudinal vibrations that can build up to damaging levels. The problem tended to appear towards the end of the S-II's burn and as a result, from Apollo 10 onwards, the centre engine was shut down about 1&frac12; minutes before the cut-off of the other four. This fix appeared to work until Apollo 13 when the centre engine (number 5) of its S-II began to shake so violently that it tripped a switch that was determining if the thrust was sufficient. As a result, the engine was commanded off. Just before it did, it was oscillating back and forth on its crossbeam supports with a fearsome acceleration of &plusmn;33.7g.
000:05:40|Pogo here is not a fearsome NASA acronym but instead is a reference to the spring-like toy hopper popular at the time. The pogo was determined to have been caused by the S-II's LOX tank pressure being slightly low. Even though it was within spec, the low supply pressure was enough to allow a slight degree of cavitation (tiny bubbles that form and collapse) to occur within the inducer/impeller of the LOX turbopump. The cavitation only happened at the low-pressure part of the pressure cycle of an otherwise acceptable pogo vibration. Yet, because it affected the pump's efficiency, it also affected the engine's thrust, and did so in a way that caused a vicious circle of vibration to quickly build up. By the time the engine was commanded off, the deflection of the crossbeams said to be 'inches'.
000:05:40|The four unaffected engines will be able to use all the remaining fuel. However, the early shutdown is not without cost as the S-II now has to accelerate the useless engine's dead weight for longer than it would otherwise have to. This will eat into the reserves of performance of the vehicle as a whole. Happily, it there will be sufficient margin to be able to continue Apollo 13's journey to the Moon.
000:05:40|The Emergency Detection System's rules do not suggest an immediate abort in the case of a single S-II engine lost. In fact, the vehicle is allowed to lose another of the S-II stage engines and still continue its ascent, unless it loses control.
000:05:52|In this abort mode, the spacecraft can make it to Earth orbit with the thrust provided by the S-IVB stage and the Service Module, but it will not have enough fuel left to attempt a lunar mission. A contingency Flight Plan for Earth orbital operations would then be exercised, should the spacecraft itself be sound still.
000:06:24|The loss of the central engine has deprived them of one fifth of their thrust, which means that their climb rate (the H-dot) has been reduced, but not to an alarming rate. Now that they are above most of the atmosphere, they can simply burn longer to reach the altitude and speed they require.
000:07:02|The level sense arm announcement informs the crew that the S-II stage automatic shutdown system has been enabled. There are five fuel level sensors and five oxidiser level sensors, and once two of them read either tank as empty, the engine cut-off sequence begins. Both the S-IC and S-II stages burn for as long as possible, to get the maximum amount of propulsion out of both. Their prolonged S-II stage burn due to the center engine cut-off is a good example of this. To drop it off with useful fuel onboard would not be economical.
000:07:14|They will now be able to make a nominal Earth orbit with the thrust of the S-IVB stage.
000:07:23|In seven and a half minutes, they have travelled 877 kilometers and climbed to 177.8 kilometers of altitude. They are almost at their planned orbital altitude - now the important part is to keep thrusting horizontally to gain enough velocity to reach and then maintain orbit.
000:08:13|Their velocity is now 5,486.4 m/s.
000:08:48|At 08:57 they reach maximum acceleration generated by the S-II stage, 1.66g's.
000:09:50|At 09:52, the outboard engines on the S-II stage cut off. Less than a second later, two solid fuel ullage rockets fire on the S-IVB stage to settle its propellants, and nearly simultaneously explosive devices separate the S-II and S-IVB stages above the conical interstage. Four small retro motors fire in the interstage to push the spent S-II stage away from the S-IVB stage.
000:09:50|The single J-2 engine on the S-IVB stage is ignited as per the same procedure as during the S-II stage ignition. The biggest difference is that a three-second chilldown of the engine thrust chamber is enacted by having the liquid fuel flow through it, instead of just one second, as on the S-II stage.
000:09:50|In Mode IV aborts, the spacecraft is separated from the S-IVB stage and the SPS engine alone is used to insert them into an Earth orbit. A contingency Flight Plan could then be enacted to perform an Earth orbital mission instead of the lunar landing.
000:09:57|The J-2 engine starts and gears up to full power in approximately 2.5 seconds, reaching the mainstage of burn.
000:10:00|After separation, as with the first stage, the S-II will continue to coast on its own trajectory until it reaches an apex height of 103.0 nautical miles or 190.7 kilometers. In fact, the spent stage goes as high up as the nominal parking orbit for the remaining Saturn V stack, although of course lacking the speed to sustain an orbit. It's suborbital trajectory will then take it down to the Atlantic for impact some 2,452.6 nautical miles (4,542.3 km) from the launch site.
000:10:00|The third stage of the Saturn V, called the S-IVB for historical reasons, could be described as a smaller version of the S-II stage in that it also consists of a single tank structure with a common bulkhead between the LH<sub>2</sub> and LOX compartments. These propellants, which are stored at the same supercold temperatures as for the S-II, are burned in a single J-2 engine which yields a thrust of 890 kN (a shade over 200,000 pounds). The engine's capability for restarting is utilised for the boost out of Earth orbit to the Moon. The construction of the S-IVB's propellant tank differs from the S-II stage by having the insulation on the inside of the tank's metal skin, a detail which made manufacture easier by not having to develop a bonding system which had to work at only 20 degrees above absolute zero. With the insulation between it and the propellant, it would be substantially warmer.
000:10:28|The PAO means distance, not altitude, here. They are 1,738 kilometers away from the launch site.
000:11:46|Fred is most likely reading out their predicted velocity at the engine cut-off time, which is more than enough for maintaining orbit.
000:12:20|The S-IVB engine cuts off at 750 seconds, 12 minutes, 30 seconds into the flight. This is approximinately 44 seconds late due to the prolonged S-II burn.
000:12:36|The launch vehicle determines that they have secured their orbit at 759 seconds, or 12 minutes, 39 seconds GET.
000:12:36|At 000:17:50 GET, the IU commands the stack into a local horizontal attitude, or orbital rate. In this orientation, they rotate slowly in pitch to maintain one side of the spacecraft always facing the Earth, coasting with the pointy end forward. This very slow motion of the stack reduces the cryogenic fuel sloshing inside the almost full tanks of the booster. It will also point the spacecraft optics towards space, to give Jack the chance to calibrate his optics and the guidance platform.
000:12:36|When the IU is in charge of maintaining their attitude during the orbit, it will do so with the Auxiliary Propulsion System, or APS.
000:12:36|The two APS modules on the S-IVB have three 150-pound thrusters and one 70-pound ullage thruster each. These allow the Instrument Unit fine attitude control of the stack without us of the Service Module's RCS thrusters.
000:13:07|At 000:13:09, a propulsive venting of the liquid H<sub>2</sub> begins by opening a valve on the S-IVB stage. This both keeps the propellants settled in their tanks and prevents the tank from pressurizing too much due to the heat leak. The valve will be closed before the second S-IVB burn to build up pressure instead of relieving it.
000:13:30|Onboard, Swigert has pressed the Verb button on the DSKY keyboard and then entered Verb 82 to display Noun 44. This gives them a display of their orbit in terms of H<sub>A</sub> and H<sub>P</sub> - or the highest and lowest points of their elliptical orbit around Earth. Mission Control can read their computer display over the telemetry radioed down to Earth.
000:13:34|Mission Control will now hurry to determine the newly launched spacecraft stack's orbit with the use of the onboard data as well as radio tracking information.
000:13:34|The S-IVB and its J-2 begin first preparations for their upcoming Translunar Injection burn as well. The engine's start tank is filled with liquid and gaseous hydrogen during the burn. It will slowly begin to gain the pressure needed for a restart of the engines by allowing the temperature inside the tank to increase through heat leak as the sunlight warms it, and hence causes the supercooled liquid to warm also, increasing its pressure. A minimum of 80 minutes is required for the pressure in the start tank to rise sufficiently for the restart. This minimum wait will also let the other components to cool down after the hardships of the first S-IVB burn.
|It is fifteen minutes into the mission of Apollo 13. The spacecraft launched on time from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, in an ascent that was textbook but for the sudden premature shutdown of the center engine on the second stage. Thanks to the guidance system's ability to adapt their trajectory despite this and the reserve capacity of the other engines and stages, they have just made it to orbit. Everything is still looking good for a nominal lunar mission to follow in a couple hours' time when they burn their S-IVB stage again during the Translunar Injection.
000:15:10|Jim Lovell is now the the world's most experienced spaceman, not only in the hours spent in space, but currently starting his unprecedented fourth space mission. He is also the first astronaut to fly on the Saturn V for the second time, and the first person to make a second journey to the Moon. His record would last until 1981, when John Young's first shuttle mission was his's fifth spaceflight.
000:15:10|Others who flew Saturn V twice are David Scott (Apollo 9 and Apollo 15), John Young (Apollo 10, Apollo 16) and Eugene Cernan (Apollo 10, Apollo 17). Lovell joins the latter two as the only three men to have made the lunar trip twice, since Scott's first mission was to the Earth orbit.
000:15:10|Their next action is to go through a very long 31-step Insertion and System Checks Checklist. This will take them to around 01:50 GET, up to the preparation for the Translunar Injection.
000:15:10|The procedures in the first step of the checklist mostly consist of securing the cabin pressurization in the Command Module, and powering off the launch-related equipment such as the EDS and the sequential systems.
000:15:10|The final part of Step 1 gives the indications on how to determine the safety of the S-IVB fuel tanks. Should the values be outside the safe range, they are to perform an emergency separation from the launch vehicle, abandoning the Lunar Module as well.
000:15:42|The Z torquing angle update is done right after orbital insertion to ensure that the inertial platform is still valid. The hardships of the powered ascent to space could have caused its careful alignment to drift off the perfect value set while still on the launch pad.
000:15:55|Their boost - with its surprises nonwithstanding - has put them on a nearly circular orbit, with a duration of 88.2 minutes.
000:23:44|Telemetry gathered from onboard sensors is encoded digitally (contemporary name being Pulse Code Modulation) into a data stream that can be radioed to Mission Control using either the high rate of 51,200 bits per second or Low rate of 1,600 bits per second.
000:24:18|Lovell and Haise are performing a quick check of the Command Module's own Reaction Control System. These are only meant to be used during reentry to control their attitude. The checkup here is an important one, should the need develop to return to Earth while in Earth orbit or immediately after the burn to send them to the Moon. Otherwise, they will wait to be used until the very end of their mission.
000:24:25|Haise sits in front of the displays for the life support system, and would be giving them a confirmation just about now for it to be safe to take off their helmets and gloves. This will improve their dexterity and comfort considerably. Should the need arise to get back into pressurized suits, they can don their gloves and helmets quickly.
000:24:25|The ECS displays have gauges for the pressure and temperature readings from the space suits, the spacecraft cabin, as well as many elements of the cooling and thermal control system.
000:25:04|They do a few selections on the radio configuration here, and power up the drinking water heater.
000:25:21|The two rookies are noting that the switches and controls in their console are stiff. This of course is due to the fact that these switches have not been operated more than a few times, unlike the well-worn out equipment in their simulators.
000:25:41|Lovell is warning Swigert to keep himself steady now that he is about to move inside the spacecraft for the first time while in microgravity. Sudden and rapid head movements may trigger space sickness, which they want to avoid by being careful during the first hours and days of the mission.
000:25:41|As can be understood from the dialogue, Jack Swigert is getting up and about, per the checklist step 8. He is the first to leave his seat and slip under the crew couches to prepare for testing parts of the life support system, and to fetch equipment needed.
000:25:41|The Command Module's pressurized interior can be considered to be divided into two distinct spaces, the upper crew area with the couches and the Main Display Console, and then the Lower Equipment Bay below them. This area, besides allowing access to some less used controls, is used to stow much of the gear they need for their trip to the Moon and back. It is also where the navigational optics are located, on their own workstation.
000:27:00|Their powered flight lasted approximately a minute longer than that of their direct predecessor, Apollo 12. Their burn lasted approx. 44 seconds longer than predicted for their own mission. Either way, the Apollo ascent is a very leisurely ride compared to the 338 seconds (five minutes, 38 seconds) it took for the two-stage Gemini-Titan launch vehicle to insert the previous American spacecraft into a similar orbit.
000:28:21|They are moving on a southeastern trajectory across the Atlantic Ocean and towards the African continent.
000:29:30|Jack, down in the LEB, is now performing a check of the main regulators, which supply the oxygen from their tanks into the cabin at the rate it is needed. Many of the controls he has to manipulate are in the form of a socket in the panel, to be cranked with a small tool he took out earlier. This saves a lot of room, not having to use large manual knobs.
000:30:49|It is implied that they all have the larger model of the spacesuit helmet, named after astronaut Frank Borman.
000:31:58|Jim Lovell infamously inflated his life belt while serving as the CMP on Apollo 8. He most likely tugged accidentally on their release while moving to the Lower Equipment Bay to perform some of the chores Jack is doing about now.
000:32:27|During the S-IC's powered flight, the engines compress the entire length of the vehicle as they place a 4-g load on it. When the engines cut out, the vehicle rebounds, throwing the crew forward for a moment.
000:32:28|TSBs aka Temporary Stowage Bags are used by the crew to reduce clutter in the cabin, by having somewhere to put frequently used items into.
000:32:36|Jim is setting up the ORDEAL (Orbital Rate Display, Earth And Lunar) - an electronics box that will allow them to modify the input into the 8-ball displays to show their orbital rate. In other words, rather than showing their attitude with respect to the stars (their inertial attitude), it will show their attitude relative to the ground below.
000:33:02|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;My feelings were as I've had previously. When we first get subjected to zero g, I feel I'm upside down, my head is full, and blood is rushing to my head; this lasts several hours. I think this sensation lasted approximately 6 hours. But basically that's the only sensation I felt in zero g. After that, it went away.&quot;
000:33:02|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I think Fred and I felt the same fullness of the head.&quot;
000:33:02|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;We both mentioned it about the same time. I don't know who mentioned it first. We both had it go away about the same time. Offhand, I don't remember how many hours had elapsed.&quot;
000:33:02|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;It was around 8 hours;we both mentioned that the fullness of the head was gone.&quot;
000:33:16|They are performing tests on the system that circulates water-glycol mixture inside the spacecraft to transfer excess heat away from the electrics to radiators that form part of the skin of the Service Module.
000:34:01|Step 11 is a check of the backup radiator system that would be brought online if the primary system fails.
000:34:36|The Apollo spacecraft's navigational instrumentation was designed for displaying their attitude in terms of spacecraft orientation in the deep space between Earth and the Moon. However, it was realized that it would be beneficial to have the capacity to also display their attitude in relation to a body being orbited, the Earth or the Moon. Due to the late conception - and budgetary reasons, apparently - the electronics were incorporated into a separate box stowed in the Command Module.
000:34:36|Turning the appropriate switches in the ORDEAL box allows them to slave the FDAI ball to display their orbital attitude, where signals from the ORDEAL electronics rotate the FDAI ball accordingly.
000:34:36|Notice the glare from the G force gauge to the left of the 8-ball - this instrument was so prone to reflecting sunlight that a cover was Velcroed onto it immediately after orbit insertion and the instrument was not used until reentry.
000:34:40|The fuel cells that produce their power and water via reacting oxygen and hydrogen are extremely sensitive to any impurities in the gases. Although filtered to be ultra-pure, even the most minute impurities will cause the fuel cell function to fall. By flowing oxygen and hydrogen through the fuel cells at a high rate, these impurities can be flushed out.
000:37:39|This step makes a thorough check of the cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen supply as well as the fuel cells and the power storage and distribution equipment onboard the Command Service Module.
000:38:37|The external hull apertures for the optics are covered for the launch. They jettison the covers here so that the instruments can now look out into space.
000:41:10|After powering up the optics, Jack will now proceed to perform the first realignment of their navigational platform. To do so, he will use program 52, hence this exercise is often called a P52. Essentially, by telling the computer where two identified stars are, the computer comes to know the orientation of the universe around the spacecraft and can therefore realign the orientation of the platform to suit. He will seek the chosen stars, line them up in his sextant, and use a button on his GNC console to mark their position. As a final check, the computer will then compare the angle between them and the expected angle stored in its memory.
000:41:54|This is a further check of the secondary cooling system.
000:43:46|Haise is about to perform a quick but thorough survey of the Electric Power System, or EPS. He will get readouts from the various cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen tanks, check the fuel cells and the amperage and the voltage of the power distribution system.
000:44:37|MSFN is the Manned Spaceflight Network and used here in references to radio contact in general, since they are outside radio signal reach for the moment. MSFN is pronounced 'misfin' by the crew.
000:51:54|To prepare to capture their upcoming docking maneuver as well as anything else they might find interesting, they are to take out three cameras. These are the 16mm Maurer 'DAC' movie camera, the 80mm Hasselblad Electric still camera, as well as the TV camera. DAC stands for Data Acquisition Camera, a telling acronym that suggests at the pure engineering mentality of NASA. They weren't taking movies for fun. This was to help engineers study aspects of the mission. Nevertheless, the films they took are often wonderful cinematic experiences and have gone down in history.
000:52:14|Carnarvon station is on the western side of Australia.
000:53:05|The heart of the guidance system is the Inertial Measurement Unit. Three gyroscopes detect any change in their attitude, while associated accelerometers detect changes in velocity. The computer can use this information to calculate their position in space with great accuracy provided it has a known starting point. Control electronics are used to translate the attitude data for display at the 8-ball FDAIs on the Main Display Console (MDC).
000:53:05|Of course, for the IMU to be of any use, its attitude data has to be referenced to something - otherwise none of its information will make any sense. Although the guidance system is based on the use of a defined three-dimensional coordinate system, this is of little use for the practical handling of the spacecraft. What they need is for the IMU to measure their attitude relative to some useful reference frame, and for the moment this is the orientation of the launch site in Florida at the moment of launch. Other references will be used as required throughout the mission. These references - or REFSMMATs - will be elaborated on later once the time comes to change the one being used.
000:53:05|This is Jack's first realignment of the guidance platform in the flight. As a reference, he sighted on star 26 Spica (Alpha Virginis) and star 33 Antares (Alpha Scorpii). As a check of his sighting accuracy, the computer compared the measured angle between these stars and the actual angle. The difference between them showed '00000' or 'all balls' on the display, indicating he had marked on them very accurately - hence the gentle ribbing from Kerwin. Finally, the computer displayed Noun 93, the angles by which the gimbals would be rotated or 'torqued' to restore perfect alignment. These were -0.067&deg; in X, 0&deg; in Y and +0.162&deg; in Z. The platform was torqued at 000:45:35.
000:53:05|The Flight Plan has a pre-printed P52 box for each of the normally scheduled IMU realignments. It serves both as a useful scratch pad for the CMP to write the information in, as well as for notekeeping for reading up to Mission Control and for post-mission debriefing.
000:58:29|Honeysuckle station is on the eastern side of Australia. It is also one of the Deep Space Network stations that will be used to maintain contact throughout the mission.
001:03:42|FM refers to frequency modulation, the manner of transmitting the television signal.
001:05:57|They slip past the coverage of the Honeysuckle station. There is no comm coverage on the Pacific for this orbit.
001:28:40|Guaymas station is in Mexico.
001:31:13|They are above California and Baja California now.
001:31:18|The onboard tape recorder - or DSE - can be remotely controlled by the ground to have its stored data transmitted to Mission Control. Right now they want to do so to check the readings from the onboard telemetry from the time they've spent outside instantaneous radio contact.
001:32:16|What Kerwin is about to read to the crew is a list of numbers known as Pre-Advisory Data, or just a PAD. The intention is to pass on important data that may be required in the future and to so in a slow and deliberate manner. Kerwin reads from a piece of paper that has been pre-formatted and the crew write the numbers onto forms laid out in an identical fashion. Once complete, the data is read back to Mission Control so that multiple flight controllers can check that the information has been accurately passed on. It is a very low tech way to transfer critical information and it illustrates an interesting aspect of an Apollo flight. While it would have been possible to have arranged a digital uplink for this data, the design of Apollo's systems was just too early for such technology to have been implemented well. However, it is not important that the data is relayed digitally, just that it is relayed accurately. In this era of analogue aviation, pilots were accustomed to using voice to pass data. For a programme developed at speed during the 1960s, Apollo didn't have to be high tech, it just had to work.
001:32:41|The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This PAD provides the details of a long burn of the SPS engine that would occur about 90 minutes after TLI in case Apollo 13 needs to make an emergency return to Earth soon after heading for the Moon.<br> <b>Systems:</b> The burn would be made using the large SPS engine at the rear of the Service Module, under the control of the Primary Guidance and Navigation System.<br> <b>CSM Weight (Noun 47):</b> 63,825 pounds (28,951 kg).<br> <b>Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48):</b> -1.54&deg; and +1.32&deg;. These angles represent an initial direction for the gimbal-mounted engine. As the burn progresses, the nozzle will be slowly steered to track shifts in the stack's centre of mass.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b> 4 hours, 6 minutes, 45.53 seconds.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, -491.7 (-149.9); y, +0.1 (+0.03); z, +6,634.0 (+2,022.0). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal).<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b> Roll, 180&deg;; Pitch, 228&deg;; Yaw, 1&deg;. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform.<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub>, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> Not applicable.<br> <b>H<sub>P</sub>, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> 17.9 nautical miles (33.2 km). The perigee distance is so low, it intersects Earth's atmosphere. What this really means is that the spacecraft will re-enter.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>T</sub>:</b> 6,652.2 fps (2,027.6 m/s). This is the total change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 7 minutes, 37 seconds.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>C</sub>:</b> 6,626.5 fps (2,019.8 m/s). Using its ability to independently measure acceleration, the EMS can shut down the engine in case the G&amp;N system fails to do so. This figure, Delta-V<sub>C</sub>, is slightly lower than Delta-V<sub>T</sub> because the EMS does not take account of the engine's tail-off thrust.<br> <b>Sextant star:</b> Star 26 (Spica, Alpha Virginis) visible in sextant when shaft and trunnion angles are 155.4&deg; and 15.7&deg; respectively. This is part of an attitude check.<br> <b>Boresight star:</b> Zeta Sagittarii is visible through the COAS (Crew Optical Alignment Sight) when the instrument is mounted in a window at an angle of 8.0&deg; up and 2.1&deg; right. This is a second attitude check.<br> The next five parameters all relate to re-entry, during which an important milestone is &quot;Entry Interface,&quot; defined somewhat arbitarily as being 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude. Another important point is when atmospheric drag on the spacecraft imparts a deceleration of 0.05g.<br> <b>Expected splashdown point (Noun 61):</b> 22.81&deg; south, 25.0&deg; west; in the South Atlantic Ocean.<br> <b>Range to go at the 0.05 g event:</b> 1,140.7 nautical miles (2,112.6 km). To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel after reaching a deceleration of 0.05g. This would be decremented later based on the deceleration sensed by the EMS' own accelerometer.<br> <b>Expected velocity at the 0.05 g event:</b> 34,087 fps (10,390 m/s). This is their inertial velocity when the the EMS is started by the 0.05 g event. Both the Range-to-go and this velocity are entered into the EMS digital displays as a starting point.<br> <b>Time of of 0.05 g event:</b> 13 hours, 32 minutes, 14 seconds GET. This is the predicted time at which the computer would begin to run the re-entry software, triggered by reaching 0.05 g.<br> <b>GDC Align stars:</b> The stars to be used for GDC Align purposes are Arcturus and Denebola. When these two stars are viewed through the telescope in the correct manner, the spacecraft's attitude will be: roll, 44&deg;; pitch, 12&deg;; yaw, 25&deg;.<br> The one additional note in the PAD is that there would be no need to perform an ullage burn to settle the contents of the SPS tanks because they are full.
001:38:42|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I noticed no communications problems. Did you?&quot;
001:38:42|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;None.&quot;
001:38:42|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Under that heading, I guess,our proposed TV show was a complete bust. The whole Gulf Coast was cloudy and what we had hoped to show was the nice coastline and there wasn't any to be seen.&quot;
001:39:41|The Lift-off + 8 PAD carries data for P37, a program in the Command Module Computer that will calculate the details of a burn that will return the crew to Earth. An important condition for P37 is that the spacecraft must still be in Earth's sphere of influence, thus simplifying the calculations. The program takes the four values from the PAD; the specified time for ignition of the engine, a specified maximum change in velocity (or Delta-V), the longitude of the splashdown and the GET for the start of re-entry. These act as a set of constraints with which it calculates the desired trajectory and the details of the burn to achieve it.
001:39:41|<b>Time of ignition:</b> 8 hours, 00 minutes.<br> <b>Delta-V:</b> 7,835 feet per second (2,388 metres/second). This is a maximum specified value.<br> <b>Longitude of splashdown:</b> 165&deg; west; <br> <b>Time of Entry Interface:</b> 22 hours, 36 minutes GET.
001:39:55|This PAD data is structurally different to other burn PADs because the maneuver is controlled by the IU on the launch vehicle and not the computer in the CM.
001:39:55|The timings for events relating to the launch vehicle are controlled by a set of time bases, computer-controlled sequences, each of which is tied to a particular event. This allows complete sequences to be timed, not to the mission time but to critical events. The restart sequence for the S-IVB's single J-2 engine is part of time base 6, which itself is tied to the calculated time to head for the Moon. This itself is determined by the mechanics of their current orbit. When TB-6 begins, all subsequent events to restart the engine such as tank repressurisation, engine chilldown, ullage, etc., follow on, leading to the engine start command 9 minutes, 30 seconds later, and ignition 8 seconds after that.
001:39:55|The crew also have tasks to perform in the minutes around the TLI burn and so to help coordinate everything, they will use their event timer. TB-6 will begin very near to the predicted time of 002:26:05, and this will be indicated by both the 'Uplink Activity' and 'S-II Sep' lamps coming on. The former is illuminated for ten seconds, the latter for 38 seconds. At 9 minutes to ignition, the 'S-II Sep' lamp will be extinguished and Jim will use this as a cue to start the event timer counting up, having previously set it to 51:00. This will give a visual count up to and beyond ignition to aid the crew in sequencing their final tasks before and during TLI. Items in the checklist are therefore shown with times from 51:00, through (1:)00:00 and upwards.
001:39:55|The PAD is interpreted as follows.<br> <b>TB-6 predict light:</b> This comes on at 002:26:05 to indicate the start of TB-6. This implies that T<sub>IG</sub> (time of ignition) will be at 002:35:43, 9 minutes and 38 seconds later. In the event, TB-6 will begin at 002:26:08.1 and ignition (the moment when the J-2's start tank is discharged) will occur at 002:35:46.4, both events a few seconds later than expected.<br> <b>Attitude for TLI:</b> 179&deg;, 108&deg;, 0&deg; in roll, pitch and yaw respectively. This attitude is stated with respect to the orientation that the guidance platform has held since launch.<br> <b>Duration of burn:</b> 5 minutes, 47 seconds.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>C'</sub>:</b> 10,416.9 fps (3,175.1 m/s) will be entered into the EMS to allow the crew to monitor the velocity that remains to be added. This will be measured by the accelerometer in the EMS as it monitors the effect of the S-IVB's burn. Therefre, the crew will observe this number decrement towards zero.<br> <b>V<sub>I</sub>:</b> Indicated velocity at engine cut-off is 35,587 fps (10,847 m/s) This they would read off the computer's numeric display.<br> <b>Separation attitude:</b> The correct attitude for separation of the CSM from the launch vehicle is 358&deg;, 139&deg;, 320&deg; in roll, pitch and yaw respectively with respect to the local vertical/local horizontal. Among the criteria for adopting this attitude is solar illumination of the LM to assist the docking procedure.<br> <b>Extraction attitude:</b> The correct attitude for extraction of the LM from the S-IVB is 302&deg;, 319&deg;, 40&deg; in roll, pitch and yaw respectively.<br> <b>Ejection time:</b> 004:01:00, the time that the CSM and LM should be ejected from the S-IVB.
001:40:44|The purpose of the translunar injection is to perform something akin to what is known as a Hohmann transfer to get to the Moon. What this means is that they will fire the S-IVB stage in order to gain more velocity, and doing so, to raise the <em>apogee</em> of their orbit. The apogee is the highest point of the orbit around the Earth, while the <em>perigee</em> is the lowest point. Currently they are in an essentially circular orbit where both the perigee and the apogee points are close to 100 nautical miles. The point in their orbit where they burn the engine will become their perigee, and the rise in velocity will also cause their apogee to rise.
001:40:44|In the case of a TLI, this engine burn to raise the perigee will turn their circular orbit into a highly elliptic one, with the new apogee beyond the orbit of the Moon. The maneuver is aimed so that by no means is this perigee around where the Moon is located at the time of the burn, but instead where they know the Moon will be approximately three days later when they approach it. This close to the Moon, the gravity of our natural satellite is strong enough to influence the trajectory of the spacecraft and to pull it behind the Moon. Should the crew do nothing, they will be thrown back towards the Earth on the so-called free return trajectory.
001:43:56|They need to enable Up Telemetry by choosing Accept so that Mission Control can upload new data into the computer.
001:43:56|The state vector is central to the spacecraft's navigation. It is six values, all of which are pertinent to a moment in time, and they state the spacecraft's position in three-dimensional coordinates, and its velocity along the three axes of the current coordinate system. An area of the computer's memory is set aside to store the current state vector and if given access, Mission Control can upload an up-to-date version of the vector, based on the latest radio tracking results.
001:43:56|They are approaching the end of the initial checklist. Step 31 remains.
001:48:16|Apollo 11 CMP Mike Collins wrote in his superb autobiography "Carrying the Fire" that, during his flight on Apollo 11, he felt this call to the spacecraft for TLI (Translunar Injection) was about as dramatic as asking for a second lump of sugar, that there ought to be more to this "umbilical snipping ceremony". Working as the CapCom during Apollo 8, Mike Collins was the first person to give such a clearance to Go. This is Jim Lovell's second TLI.
001:48:16|Huntsville, Alabama is the location of the Marshall Space Flight Center. This is where Wehrner von Braun and his team designed the Saturn V rocket, and would be the obvious source of calculations on the status of the S-IVB.
001:48:16|3-sigma comes from statistics. Sigma is shorthand for standard deviation, a measure of the spread of a normal distribution, the distinctive bell-shaped curve that is typical when probabilities are measured. 1 sigma on either side of the centre of the curve encompasses about 70 per cent of all outcomes while 2 sigma accounts for 95 per cent. Plus and minus 3 sigma is right on the edge of the curve and encompasses 99.6 per cent of the total probability. 3 sigma is treated as a worst case if all the uncertanties (e.g. propellant load, engine performance, mass estimations) go against them and Kerwin is informing the crew that they have enough propellant to cope with that unlikely event.
001:49:36|The probe is a contraption that sits inside the docking tunnel at the nose of the spacecraft. Placing the switch to Extend pushes the tip of the probe forward. Latches on the bulbous tip will fit into a hole at the centre of a conical drogue in the recipient side on the Lunar Module. The probe will provide initial capture between two spacecraft, giving safety separation so that they won't simply bump onto each other, and the probes mechanism will also be used to pull them together and align the docking ring system for the 'hard' docking with mechanical latches.
001:51:00|This is step 31 of the Insertion and Systems Checklist, and the very final entry on it. From now on, they will go to the TLI Preparation Checklist for their procedures.
001:51:00|For practically every crucial part of the mission, some of the onboard functions are commanded automatically by a set of electronics boxes which form the Sequential Events Control System, or SECS. These events are those of utmost critical nature such as the firing of pyrotechnic devices. These sequential events often contain many things that must happen at once or in a strict order, and hence an electronic control system handles them to allow for maximum level of success. Before any of these events take place, however, the Seq Logic and Pyro Arm switches must be set to On position and their power supplies enabled from the associated circuit breakers.
002:26:12|The beginning of time base 6 means the start of the automatic sequence to prepare the S-IVB stage for its second burn, the Translunar Injection. The burn will take place 9 minutes, 38 seconds after the initiation of time base 6.
002:26:12|Both the 'Uplink Activity' and 'S-II Sep' lamps have come on, giving a visual indication of the start of time base 6.
002:26:12|To start the procedure for re-firing the stage, the H<sub>2</sub> venting is terminated. The automatic sequence will also start up a small H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> burner located on the bottom of the rocket stage, which will draw the two propellants from the main tanks. It will combust oxygen and hydrogen in a small reaction chamber, and the resulting hot gas is let out through a nozzle, which appears like a tiny rocket engine. The burner produces an insignificant amount of thrust with this gas flow, but what it produces is a lot of heat. Helium from the onboard storage sphere tanks is piped into tubing around this nozzle to heat it up, and then directed into the hydrogen and oxygen tanks to begin pressurizing them for the upcoming second engine burn.
002:27:11|The S-IVB chilldown begins, continuing the preparations for the system to commit the engine burn that will send them to the Moon.
002:33:30|The Translunar Injection burn will be performed over the Pacific Ocean. No ground tracking stations are available at the area, which would mean that the spacecraft would perform this crucial maneuver outside radio contact with Mission Control. For this purpose, aircraft flying from Australia will act as mobile radio stations to maintain contact with Apollo 13.
002:33:30|The land track of the TLI burn is over Australia, The Coral Sea, and east of the Solomon Islands.
002:33:30|The APS thrusters on the S-IVB stage begin the ullage burn to settle the propellants for the burn.
002:34:28|The O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> burner is turned off. Pressurization of the propellant tanks is continued from the supply of ambient temperature helium from storage spheres on the thrust structure at the very bottom of the S-IVB stage. This ensures that the liquid oxygen and hydrogen tanks are up to nominal pressure once the burn begins.
002:35:40|The engine chilldown is terminated around this point. The supercooled propellants are allowed to run into the combustion chamber walls. The start tank of hydrogen is discharged into the turbines to spin up the turbopumps in a restart of the engine. Pressure bled from the engine assembly is routed into the oxygen and hydrogen tanks to continue pressurization.
002:36:09|As for the ascent, there is a data card for the crew to interpret the data on their DSKY display for the TLI burn as well.
002:41:45|The DSKY display is frozen by hitting the Verb button. This retains the latest displayed information on it. This is the first part of the post-burn checklist.
002:41:45|Note how some of the writing on the most heavily used keys has worn off!
002:41:45|Their immediate actions after the TLI burn are mostly to record the burn information and to secure the Sequential Events Control System and the hand controllers.
002:41:53|The Entry Monitoring System's own display for their velocity shows they are three feet per second short.
002:42:18|Lovell turns a switch in the ORDEAL box from Orb Rate position to Inertial, hence restoring the 8-ball to display their position in relation to the inertial platform, instead of the orbital rate that they used during their orbit and the subsequent TLI burn.
002:42:22|They turn off the hand controllers to make sure they won't make accidental maneuvers by bumping on them.
002:42:45|Verb 66 Enter copies the Command Module's navigational state vector into a section of the erasable memory used for storing the Lunar Module's state vector. For now, they use it as space for a spare copy. They will also close the Waste Stowage Vent to secure cabin pressurization, and start setting up the High Gain Antenna they will soon need for their upcoming TV broadcast of the docking procedures.
002:46:19|Fred Haise now reads the values that were frozen on the display earlier on. Their velocity is 35,560 feet per second or 10,838.68 metres per second. The EMS counter is used to display the residual velocity left to be gained, a mere 3 fps, or 1 m/s.
|Apollo 13 has been propelled towards the Moon through the Translunar Injection burn of the S-IVB stage. Now is the time for another crucial maneuver in the flight itinerary. They are to separate from the spent Saturn V booster, turn the Command Service Module around and dock with the Lunar Module <i>Aquarius</i> still nestled on top of the S-IVB.
|The stack, as it stands currently, is 132 feet long (40 metres) and has a mass of some 134,000 pounds or 60,780 kg. This consists of the fully fueled Command-Service Module plus three astronauts, the Lunar Module, the dead weight of the S-IVB and the remaining unusable fuel in the spent booster.
002:57:57|Mission Control is now crunching the data on the TLI burn to see just how close to their intended trajectory they have managed to get with the S-IVB burn. This will determine how much of a course adjustment will have to be made during the midcourse correction maneuvers.
002:58:36|Four flush-mounted low-power microwave antennas known as Omni A through D are installed 90 degrees apart on the base of the Command Module. They provide communications on the Unified S-Band while close to the Earth and when low bandwidth is appropriate, or when the larger High Gain Antenna is stowed. For the moment it is still inaccessible, being folded inside the SLA section.
002:58:36|They begin preparations for docking with the Lunar Module by allowing more oxygen to flow into the cabin, raising the pressure. This excess pressure will be bled out when they use oxygen from the Command Module to pressurize the LM. They will also set up the computer to provide stabilization of the spacecraft via the Digital Autopilot.
003:01:52|The upcomimg maneuver is performed under crew control. This means that they will power up the hand controllers and the SECS pyrotechnics which will be used to separate the two spacecraft. The Entry Monitoring System's digital display will again be used to show velocity changes.
003:05:39|They've kept the waste management vent valve open to let a small amount of onboard atmosphere to escape, to flush out any remaining nitrogen.
003:05:55|At separation, pyrotechnic devices release the Command Module from the top of the S-IVB booster. At the same time, shaped charges split the SLA panels open and they are released from the base to allow them to float away. At the same time, the Command Module Pilot uses the Translational Hand Controller to apply forward thrust for five seconds to increase their velocity andm ove them away from the S-IVB.
003:05:55|The checklist also calls for the crew to check the status of the fuel and pressurization valves in the Service Module's RCS packages. It was well known from past missions - Apollo 9, 11 and 12 as of latest - that the shock from the S-IVB separation could close the electric solenoid valves inadvertedly. The situation could then be fixed by cycling the valves between ON and OFF positions to restore them. No such complications were experienced during Apollo 13, although the issue resurfaced for Apollo 15.
003:07:38|After separating from the booster and moving away to a safe distance, the CSM will pitch around a complete 180 degrees until they are facing the S-IVB and the Lunar Module still held on the top.
003:07:44|The Command Module Pilot has two hand controllers at his disposal. Swigert can use the RHC to impart a change in attitude to any direction. The RCS control electronics then fire the thrusters in a manner that changes their attitude without changing their velocity to any direction. This is especially important for fine maneuvering.
003:07:44|The Translational Hand Controller allows Swigert to move in all three dimensions, but also to impart a velocity change by maintaining controlled in a particular position. He will need to do that to nullify the earlier acceleration to get away from the S-IVB and then to reduce their relative velocity so that they will actually start to move towards the booster and the awaiting LM.
003:09:52|The Apollo TV camera utilizes a vidicon tube to generate a black and white television picture. A rotating color wheel with red, green and blue filters in front of the black and white television vidicon sensor allows these images to be encoded with the color information. Processing facilities on Earth turn this signal into a color image compatible with commercial TV.
003:09:58|A 16mm film camera is running concurrently to the TV, and due to the much better quality, frames from the 16mm film are used in this sequence to illustrate their docking maneuver.
003:09:58|Swigert uses the COAS through the left rendezvous window in the Command Module to aim at the Lunar Module.
003:09:58|By using the COAS' projected reticle, the piloting crewmember (Swigert this time) lines up the Command Module with the docking target on the top of the Lunar Module. By moving forward very slowly, he can maintain this relative position, and bring them together for the docking probe to attach into the docking drogue.
003:12:23|The BMAGs, or Body Mounted Attitude Gyros, are a pair of gyroscopes strapped into the spacecraft structure. Any motions detected by them are electronically converted into signals that drive needle indicators in the FDAI 8-ball to show them their 'rates' - motion to any direction. They can now use this information to monitor their motion as they prepare to perform the docking. They also work as a backup to the IMU, should it fail.
003:13:49|Fred Haise is moving the camera to give an interior view from the cabin. The FDAI and the DSKY are prominently seen.
003:17:07|Two indicators known as talkbacks turn to show 'barberpole' - grey and white flags reminiscent of the old barber's symbol.
003:17:07|The capture latches at the tip of the docking probe are now in place at the drogue inside the LM tunnel. They will now use the probe to pull their spacecraft together, which will then cause the docking latches to automatically snap closed and secure them structurally together.
003:18:52|This diagram illustrates the most remarkable challenge in the design of the docking system - how to bring the two spacecraft together in a way that will also allow the crew the pass between them? The solution of the drogue, the docking ring, and the removable probe is remarkable, if somewhat cumbersome. It was selected out of the several options considered for its low weight and reliability.
003:20:22|With the docking completed, they begin preparations for setting up the LM for the coast.
003:30:46|The LM is pressurized with oxygen from the Command Module cabin. A lengthy checklist is required for this procedure. One part of it is turning off the emergency cabin pressurization system in the Command Module so that it doesn't interpret the sudden flow of air from the Command Module into the LM as a leak and start to pump up oxygen at an unnecessary rate.
003:31:47|The LM pressurization is controlled via a valve on the hatch and a multi-position selector in the Command Module. The LM is launched with an open cabin valve so that it depressurizes during the ascent to orbit. After docking, the crew in the CM provides it with a fresh atmosphere via the tunnel.
003:37:18|Here they unlock the top hatch, to get into the docking tunnel. This is necessary for connecting the two spacecraft together electrically in a moment.
003:38:17|The automatic docking latches are accessible from inside the tunnel, and can be operated manually to make sure they are locked. This is also how they are opened for the undocking for lunar landing.
003:42:30|The S-IVB can boost its speed by remotely controlled vening of the remaining cryogenic gases inside. This and the APS thrusters are used to finetune its trajectory to its planned impact on the lunar surface.
003:42:30|The camera is struggling to produce a clear imagine in the low light conditions inside the docking tunnel.
003:42:30|Step 9 has a crewmember - Jim Lovell in this case - connect electric cables into sockets on the LM and the CM. These power cables enable them to transfer Command Module-generated power into the Lunar Module. This external power is used for electric heaters used to keep crucial systems such as the guidance platform within their safe operational temperatures. This is done to save the LM battery power which cannot be replenished. The cable will also carry the commands they will soon issue to the pyrotechnic devices that will separate the LM from the S-IVB booster.
003:44:21|A miniature CRT monitor is provided for use with the onboard TV camera, to help with lining the shot.
003:45:59|Once the umbilical is plugged in, they'll enable the LM POWER circuit breakers and flip a switch in the Main Display Console. This sents a signal to the LM's control electronics to switch off the internal battery power, and start drawing on the externally provided CSM power instead.
003:46:23|To read the status of the power being transferred into the Lunar Module via the umbilicals, a crewman must slip to the Lower Equipment Bay to make this checkup on the Systems Test Meter. It consists of a round voltimeter of the type seen on the Main Display Console, and two rotating knobs. By combining the numeric and alphabetic selections (such as 4-D for the LM amperage), the voltimeter displays the requested value. A chart in the crew checklist provides a means to interpret this information in a meaningful form.<br> <br>During early Command Module development, the original name of the display - Systems Test Meter- would have been even more prominent, considering that it was meant to be used to troubleshoot possibly malfunctioning components, before enacting in-flight repairs. Both actions were deleted, for designing the ship around in-flight design capacity actually made many of its systems less reliable and added unnecessary complexity, and worst of all, weight to the chronically too heavy spacecraft system where every pound of payload matters. It was decided to increase redundancy instead.
003:46:23|The Systems Test Meter gives its readout as a measure of volts on the gauge. A printed chart is used to interpret this into the required value. Albeit somewhat awkward, this provided a handy way for the crew to gain access to rarely required readouts from the systems that did not have their dedicated displays on the Master Display Console or elsewhere in the cockpit. This saved a lot of precious space and reduced clutter as well.
003:55:20|For the separation of the Lunar Module from the S-IVB, they set up the EMS to monitor acceleration, set up the Digital Autopilot (DAP) and prepare the sequential systems for firing the pyros.
003:57:04|Fred is referring to the Hycon camera, a high resolution reconnaissance camera that is intended to be used by Jack to photograph the lunar surface in higher definition than is possible with the Hasselblad cameras used by the crew. It was designed to be attached to mountings around the hatch's circular window, number 3.
003:58:29|Page 3-4a offers the crew drawn sketches on how the discarded S-IVB should appear to them at various times and distances after the separation.
004:00:59|The switches for performing separation of various components of the spacecraft are under the DSKY. They have protective covers to ensure no accidental operation.
004:00:59|A single flip of a switch fires the pyrotechnics. The checklist is also reminding the crew to start the 16 mm film camera and the clock to time their separation maneuver.
004:00:59|Despite the page after page of notes on preparation, the actual separation is a fairly simple affair in terms of crew procedures. A single guarded switch is turned, which fires the pyrotechnics on the ties that hold the Lunar Module in place inside the SLA/SIV-B. Afterwards, Swigert fires the RCS jets on the Service Module to impart acceleration and pull the LM away from the Saturn V.
004:01:19|The post-separation checklist suggests them to put the computer to 'idle' mode, or Program 00, (known as P00 or 'Pooh' as in Winnie. They secure the sequential systems, the EMS, the onboard tape recorder, and the telemetry radioed to Earth.
004:01:19|The conversion of the TV signal to something compatible with standard systems was an involved process. The tape was used to provide timing correction whereby one tape machine recorded the video signal from the spacecraft while locked to the timing of that signal. The tape from that machine then went straight to a second machine that replayed it, but this machine was locked to a standard timing. The video then passed to a magnetic recorder that reconstructed the combined colour image from the sequential colour images (what the PAO announcer calls 'sequential black and white'). All this processing added significant delay to the TV coverage from Apollo with respect to the audio fro the crew.
004:10:13|Mission Control is commanding the S-IVB to move away from the Command Module, so that it can begin its own mission, and to avoid any potential for an accidental collision between the Apollo stack and their spent booster.
004:10:56|APS is one of the rare double acronyms in the Apollo programme - APS can also refer to the Ascent Propulsion System, in the Lunar Module. Considering the two systems work at two very different parts of the mission and onboard different spacecraft, there is no real danger of confusing them.
004:14:04|Swigert is reporting that they have received a warning for high oxygen flow. Although it can be triggered by a variety of things, one of the more sinister causes for alarm is loss of cabin oxygen through a leak.
004:19:37|The HGA controls allow them to manually adjust the positioning of the antenna.
004:25:05|One of the standard procedures to be repeated throughout any normal Apollo mission is battery recharging. The three Command Module re-entry batteries are connected to the power system whenever extra loads are expected. When the batteries are not being used, they can be recharged from spare power generated by the fuel cells when the power loads are low. This is also beneficial to the fuel cells themselves, for they require a certain baseline load to stay within their operational temperatures. Although a routine operation, the Flight Plan even has a whole page dedicated to the battery charging schedule.
|It is nearing six pm on a Saturday, the 11th of April, 1970. For three men, this is not an ordinary weekend, as they are almost five hours into their flight to the Moon onboard Apollo 13. The excitement of the launch, the boost for the Moon and retrieving the Lunar Module are behind them, and now the astronaut trio has the chance to catch their breaths while performing some spaceflight chores and get settled for the three-day coast ahead of them.
004:51:45|Joe Kerwin would definitely know what Swigert's talking about, being a jet pilot himself.
004:54:05|The EMS is a display system that provices the crew with visual cues to the status of their Earth reentry. Should the automatic guidance system fail, this info can be used to perform a manually controlled landing. During the translunar coast, however, it performs a secondary, if important function as a backup display instrument for vehicle acceleration. The EMS has its own accelerometer that measures spacecraft acceleration. The EMS bias test determines the amount of error this accelerometer might display. This is important, since the EMS can be set to terminate later engine burns using the SPS.
004:54:40|The second opportunity for midcourse correction will be during the next day. It will be a small burn, using the Service Propulsion Engine.
004:55:48|Mission Control is about to use the S-Band radio to load new guidance data into the Command Module Computer. In preparation to starting Passive Thermal Control, or PTC, they are reconfiguring the guidance system to work using a new reference frame or a REFSMMAT.
004:55:48|The aptly named REFSMMAT stands for "Reference to a Stable Member Matrix". While this alone says little to the uninitiated, the basic idea can be easily summed up. The guidance computer determines their position and attitude on a three-dimensional coordinate system known as the BRC. The Basic Reference Coordinate System determines three-dimensional space using the relationship between the Earth-Moon system, the Sun, and Earth's orbit around the sun. Although this makes it very useful for navigational purposes, it is cumbersome in terms of practical operations of the spacecraft. What the crew needs is for their attitude reference system to be able to tell them where their nose is pointing, within what is the most useful frame of reference to be used at the time. For the launch and immediately thereafer this is the launch site, because they will know exactly where and when they leave, and which direction they are going from that point. For the long coast between the Earth and the Moon, Florida is not as useful. Hence they update the computer to instead utilize the relationship between the Earth and the Moon as the reference point.
005:30:18|Instead of reading the numbers over the radio, Mission Control can view them as they appear on Swigert's DSKY onboard, thanks to the telemetry.
005:30:51|For this second realignment of the guidance platform, Jack has sighted on star 35 Rasalhague (Alpha Ophiuchi) and star 44 Enif (Epsilon Pegasi). As a check of his sighting accuracy, the comparison of the measured angle between these stars and the actual angle is 0.01&deg;, a good but not perfect result. The angles by which the gimbals are rotated or 'torqued' to restore perfect alignment are 0.175&deg; in X, 0.172&deg; in Y and 0.012&deg; in Z. The platform was torqued at 005:28 according to the post-flight Mission Report.
005:30:51|Jack is now using the previously uplinked PTC REFSMMAT alignment, and made sure that the inertial platform is aligned to this reference, rather than the launch PEFSMMAT used for the first few hours.
005:41:48|The Lift-off + 15 PAD carries data for P37, a program in the Command Module Computer that will calculate the details of a burn that will return the crew to Earth. An important condition for P37 is that the spacecraft must still be in Earth's sphere of influence, thus simplifying the calculations. The program takes the four values from the PAD; the specified time for ignition of the engine, a specified maximum change in velocity (or Delta-V), the longitude of the splashdown and the GET for the start of re-entry. These act as a set of constraints with which it calculates the desired trajectory and the details of the burn to achieve it.
005:41:48|<b>Time of ignition:</b> 15 hours, 00 minutes.<br> <b>Delta-V:</b> 5,622 feet per second ( 1,713.6 meters/second). This is a maximum specified value.<br> <b>Longitude of splashdown:</b> 165&deg; west; <br> <b>Time of Entry Interface:</b> 47 hours, 4 minutes GET.
005:55:12|Starting at the 6-hour point in the mission, as per the Flight Plan, Jack Swigert begins star sightings for the purpose of calibrating the onboard optics, as well as refining their trajectory data. He sets the computer to point the spacecraft optics towards five stars - Antares, Delta Capricornii, Theta Scorpii, Altair and Peacock - and takes markings of them, which are recorded into the computer memory. He will then take sightings of the Earth horizon, and uses the computer to calculate the angle between the stars and the horizon being marked. This angle can be used to tell their location in the space between Earth and the Moon.
005:55:12|Sighting the Earth horizon is known to be a challenge, even to the experienced Apollo navigator. Each Command Module Pilot has a tendency to mark it at a particular distance, with a certain amount of error to the true location of the horizon, but they've also shown themselves to be very consistent with this. The computer can hence be updated to take into account each individual Command Module Pilot's personal error in terms of their horizon sighting accuracy. For Swigert, it was determined to be 24 kilometers, which is comparable to that of his predecessors on Apollos 10, 11 and 12. Apollo 8 CMP Jim Lovell's mark was at 32 kilometers, rather.
006:16:37|The High Gain Antenna can be set to automatically try to maintain lock with the ground station by selecting that function.
006:45:03|Swigert's P23 sighting results will be incorporated into the state vector, the computerized record of their position at any given time. For the moment, their main purpose is to act as a backup to the ground-derived state vector, which is based on land-based radar and radio signal tracking.<br> <br>Original plans for the Apollo guidance system were more reliant on the onboard navigation. It was believed that ground-based tracking would not be accurate enough for the purpose of landing men on the Moon. Later experience with remote controlled probes and the first manned missions proved otherwise, and this relegated the onboard navigation to a secondary, if important role. Should the spacecraft's radio systems fail, cutting off their contact with Mission Control, their safe return home would be down to the efforts of onboard navigation.
006:45:30|Their initial TLI burn has been accurate enough that there is no need to adjust their course at this point.
006:45:42|They are about to proceed with a scheduled purge of the fuel cell to remove any impurities from it that might impair the reaction process. They will also dump water onboard that has been generated as an excess product of the fuell cell reaction, and by the Environmental Control System.
006:49:37|The Hawaii tracking station has been handling their communications since shortly after the Translunar Injection. Now their trajectory relative to the surface of the Earth has moved enough eastwards that the Goldstone station will be best positioned to maintain line of sight with them. With Apollo 13 moving further and further away, they rise above the line of the sight of the Deep Space Network stations in Goldstone, California, Honeysuckle, Australia and Madrid, Spain. The three stations will be able to maintain continuous contact, unless the spacecraft happens to be behind the Moon.
006:49:37|As they move further and further away from Earth, their horizontal speed in relation to the surface of the Earth slows down. Eventually, at greater distances, the rotation of the Earth will catch up with the spacecraft and as seen from the map above, the land track forms a loop before starting to head west. At this point the vertical speed is so high in relation to the horizontal speed, that the surface of the Earth in relation to the spacecraft moves quite slowly and will need about one day for a full circle. From now on until recovery, the communications will always be handed over to the next station west from the present one.
006:59:35|This is by the book, leaving the waste water tank about 25% full.
007:09:38|Astronaut Vance Brand has taken over the CapCom position in Mission control. It is now 8 pm in Houston, Texas. The flight control team changed shifts about an hour previously, but the CapComs use a different rotation where they partially overlap the Flight Control shifts.
007:09:53|Vance Brand was present for the launch in Florida and has traveled back to Houston to support the mission there. It is 900 miles by air and over a thousand miles by road.
007:17:45|The first in a sequence of eleven photographs of Earth is taken. The plan is that as the spacecraft rotates in its PTC roll, a shot will be taken, though the roll is yet to be established. In the event, though the timing between frames is about 22 minutes, there will be a delay of an hour between the second and third image. Note that Jim keeps his microphone open long enough for both the shutter click to be heard as well as the winding on of the electric Hasselblad camera.
007:18:37|Lovell must be referring to Jack's continued P23 sightings, which involves the spacecraft moving so that he can point the optics at the stars he wants.
007:18:37|The PTC or Passive Thermal Control is an elegant solution to preventing the unfiltered sunlight in deep space from overheating the spacecraft. By having it rotate slowly along its central axis, no part of the spacecraft skin will receive more heat than the other. This way the thermal stress is divided evenly and will not cause issues during the long coast to the Moon. To do so, they will use the RCS thrusters to set up the rotation, which the Command Module Computer will then maintain. Here the intention is to use quads C and D for the PTC, since less fuel have been used from then than the two other quads.
007:18:37|The PTC was known as the 'barbeque roll' in astronaut and public parlance alike.
007:33:50|The plan is to use the Command Module's Omni antennas to maintain radio contact during the PTC rotation.
007:39:49|This is the second photo in the weather sequence.
007:40:39|Before the PTC can be started, their motion on any of the axes (X,Y,Z) must be nulled. These movements are known as rates, and stopping them is known as damping the rates.
007:55:32|The Flight Plan has simulated views on how the Earth and the Moon should appear when viewed from the spacecraft at a given time. These images were not drawn by hand but were generated on a UNIVAC 1108 mainframe utilizing a visualization system originally designed for the Gemini program.
008:09:20|The term 'couple' in this context refers to the use of jets on opposite sides of the spacecraft to effect a rotation that has very little translation component to it. Coupled jets are particularly important in the early stages of a translunar trajectory because even a small unintended translation can have a profound efect on the eventual destination of the spacecraft.
008:09:51|They've discovered a small error from the onboard documentation which has made it difficult to maintain the careful PTC roll.
008:20:47|The spacecraft should be rotating at .3 degrees per second. For some reason, the original value input in the computer has not produced the desired rotation rate, but requires adjustment by giving the computer a new figure.
008:27:55|The nominal fuel consumption for each phase of the mission has been calculated beforehand. The crew has references to it in Section IV of the Flight Plan. An example of an RCS consumption graph <a href="pics/table4-3.png" target="_blank">can be viewed here.</a>
008:42:11|Fred has taken the third photo in the weather sequence.
009:03:17|This is photo number four in the weather sequence.
009:24:46|Jack has stumbled upon a bug in the computer system, but thankfully the Guidance people at Mission Control have the solution at hand. By inputting VERB 25 NOUN 07 they can get access to that part of the computer memory the crew can rewrite while enroute. They specify the location of the piece of code they want to modify, and input the desired value that will then reset the individual bits that govern the computer's knowledge of the status of the navigational optics.
009:26:39|This is the fifth photo in the weather sequence.
009:46:39|Fred Haise isn't joking here, because the onboard timer is exactly what he says it is.
009:47:15|This is the sixth photo in the weather sequence.
009:50:15|The music can only be heard when any of the astronauts presses the button used to talk to Earth. With the microphone close to their mouths for capturing their words, it does not always pick up a lot of the ambient noise from the cabin, such as music being played on the small Sony cassette recorder.

010:40:15|Jack has completed his third realignment of the guidance platform. This time he used Option 3 of the Program 52, which enables him to correct any drift in the platform from the inertial orientation dictated by the PTC REFSMMAT. He sighted on star 20 Dnoces (Iota Ursa Majoris) and star 27 Alkaid (Eta Ursa Majoris). His sighting accuracy was spot on as the computer found no difference when comparing the measured angle between these stars and the actual angle, this 000.00, or 'five balls'. The angles by which the gimbals are rotated or 'torqued' to restore perfect alignment are 0.123&deg; in X, 0.113&deg; in Y and 0.092&deg; in Z. The platform was torqued at 010:40 according to the post-flight Mission Report.

011:20:55|The crew of Apollo 13 implies that they have discovered an unusual piece of signage from the Lower Equipment Bay, where a secondary DSKY computer interface is located next to the navigational optics station. It appears someone has named their onboard computer after the artificial intelligence from the cult movie '2001:A Space Odyssey' which would have come out a year and a half previous in September, 1968. Vance Brand's coy reply implies that he might have something to do with this prank. As a member of the mission astronaut support crew and having been present in Cape prior to the launch, it is possible that he has personally orchestrated the joke. No mention of it has been made in any of the official reports or less official memoirs, however.
011:32:46|The first point that Brand makes refers to how consistently Jack selects a part of Earth's indistinct horizon to mark on. The second referred to the substellar point, the point on Earth limb which is nearest to the star from the spacecraft's perspective. When Jack measures the angle between Earth and a star, he has to do so along a line from the star to the nearest pont of the limb. This line is naturally an imprecise thing to judge.
011:37:20|This is the last of the 11 images taken for the weather sequence.

012:00:13|This mysterious device is the so-called tone booster. When plugged into the utility power supply, it will produce a loud, audible alarm should MASTER ALARM go off. This is to ensure that the crew will be alerted sufficiently even if they are asleep and not wearing their communications headsets while resting. The tone booster had no electronic connection to the Caution and Warning System itself - instead, an optical sensor sensitive only to the wavelength of red light emanated by the MASTER ALARM lamp is used to 'remotely' trigger the device. A remarkable solution!
012:03:14|This data block has data for programming four different Earth return burns at various times after their launch. There are four sets of parameters for each option. The first are:<br> <b>Time of ignition:</b> 25 hours, 00 minutes.<br> <b>Delta-V:</b> 5,110 feet per second (1,557.53 metres/second).

012:04:14|The PAD for Lift-off plus 35 hours will be updated in just over 12 hours time due to inclement weather being forecast for the predicted landing area at 70 hours
012:08:24|A number of chores are to be performed before they can settle in for the night. They have just performed the first step, which is a verbal report on their physical wellbeing. They are about to check some gauges and electric readouts. The fans in the cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen tanks are operated for a few minutes to settle their contents, which would ensure that the fuel cells will continue to function without trouble while they are sleeping. Even non-threatening shifts in the reactant flows could lead to an annoying interruption of their sleep. They will also use a large syringe to inject a small amount of chlorine into their drinking water supply to make sure no microbes will contaminate it.
012:11:17|The Flight Plan has preprepared boxes for writing down information in a standardised format, such as one of these updates.
012:13:02|They want to close the waste went before the crew goes to sleep, so as not to have oxygen flowing deliberately out of the spacecraft while they are in bed.
012:17:47|The onboard computer has an erasable memory section in the form of a ferrite core, and it consists of 2,048 words of 16-bit data. This 2K memory can be downlinked to Mission Control so that their computer experts can take a look at it, via punching in VERB 74 into the computer. This initiates the e-memory dump over the radio.
012:47:43|Joking or not, the electroluminescent displays have a limited lifetime, and having it on for hours unnecessarily is not preferable.
012:48:18|It is just past 2 in the morning in Houston, where Vance Brand is manning the console.
012:48:45|For the Command Module, the plan is to have the crew sleep in what is almost like a bunk bed arrangement. Two sleep stations with sleeping bags are rigged under the left and right crew couches, while the third crewmember sleeps on the right hand seat. It was known for the crew to vary between these positions, and also occasionally to sleep on the left side couch instead.
012:48:45|The 'sleep restraint' is a lightweight sleeping bag made out of fireproof Beta cloth. Their main purpose is, as the name suggests, to keep the sleeping crewmen in place so as to prevent them from floating around the cabin. This could be both uncomfortable and also dangerous, since they could accidentally hit crucial controls while sleeping. They can also be used for tying down unused space suits during reentry, if the crew is not wearing them.
|April 12th, 1970. Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise have been whisked off to the Moon in a giant ballistic lob onboard the Saturn V booster, and are now coasting away while enjoying a well-deserved sleep. Their three days of coast will be filled with systems maintenance and preparing for the lunar landing waiting for them at Fra Mauro. Great plans also exist for the orbital science to be performed by Swigert while flying solo around the Moon. To get there, however, the plan for the second day of the mission will include a a course change to refine their trajectory for lunar approach.
|Flying close to the Moon will have the lunar gravity alter their trajectory from the original ellipse into a kind of a figure 8, which sends them back over to Earth. Several pre-calculated times for mid-course corrections are marked on the above diagram. Only the necessary ones are used, although the capacity exists for all of them, should they be required. Apollo 13's TLI has been accurate enough that only one midcourse correction is planned for the moonbound leg of their journey.
023:11:17|It's 24 minutes past 12 in the afternoon in Houston.
023:11:54|Fred Haise later recalls that things weren't quite as pleasant as they made them sound like on the radio. This is perhaps not unexpected. Astronauts were famously reticent to discuss their medical status on the open radio loop.
023:11:54|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;On the morning of the second day, I woke up with a pretty severe headache. I drank some juice and ate some bacon cubes. That didn't sit right and I upchucked about 2 ounces of my juice. I sat still for about half a day pretty much; I never had any symptoms again after that.&quot;
023:11:54|Fred's malaise was later attributed to space sickness. The exact etiology of this condition is still somewhat unclear, but it is most likely caused by confusing sensory input received by the brain from the balance organs inside the ear. This is akin to motion sickness experienced in more terrestial vehicles, but caused by weightlnessness. Astronauts experience nausea, vomiting, malaise and discomfort associated with moving their heads in zero G. Waiting it out appears to be the only effective remedy - as Fred discovered as well.
023:17:17|Each crewmember wears a passive dosimeter, which will gather data on any radiation exposure they might experience while in space. Any Apollo astronauts going to the Moon are outside the protection offered by the Earth's magnetic field, and hence the various sources of radiation in space, such as cosmic background radiation and the sun, are a true concern.
023:17:17|It is not random information that they pass on in regards to the sleeping arrangements. Their exposure to radiation is governed by many variables, including their position inside the spacecraft. This affects just how much dense material they have between themselves and any possible high energy rays or particles coming from the outside. The crew wore the dosimeters under their spacesuits and were supposed to move them to the pockets of their flight coveralls, but apparently forgot. This would not be the first nor the last time the Apollo crews showed somewhat absentminded regard to the radiation safety measures.
023:18:45|Sleeping in weightlessness is not easy, especially to start with. Combined with the excitement of a spaceflight, it is no surprise that sometimes the crews resorted to the barbiturate sleeping pills carried onboard.
023:19:57|Cone Crater is their landmark in their Fra Mauro landing target zone.
023:20:45|Varying temperature in the cryogenic tanks can cause the semi-fluid, semi-gaseous material to form layers of different density. This can cause the pressure to go past the sensor level to trip the alarm to warn the crew about such a state. Mixing the contents of the tank with the electric fans is a way to homogenize the contents. This is a standard chore for the crew to maintain their power system.
023:22:00|This changes some time parameters that are involved with the calculation of the spacecraft's state vector.

023:23:50|The booster briefing is in a form of questions pre-written in their Flight Plan. They are adding a few more questions to further investigate the S-II center engine premature shutdown. In Apollo parlance, these crew observations and sensations would be known as 'physiological cues' to something being awry.
023:25:35|Jim is the first person to fly on the Saturn V twice, hence he is the perfect (and only!) man to answer.
023:26:00|The ORDEAL mode on the 8-ball is used during the TLI as well to observe their attitude.
023:26:14|A series of gauges in the Main Display Console shows the quantity and pressure status in the spacecraft's four cryogenic H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> tanks in the Service Module. The onboard readouts are subject to more inaccuracies than the values derived in Mission Control from a variety of sensors and taking into account many variables needed to get a good reading. Hence the comparison is important to make sure that both the crew and Mission Control knows where they stand in terms of their consumables.
023:26:14|The quantity of Reaction Control System (RCS) fuel is described in terms of propellant left in pounds.
023:47:30|Jack has completed his fourth realignment of the guidance platform. This is done to compensate for any drift from their perfect alignment to the PTC REFSMMAT orientation on their IMU. He sighted on star 31 Arcturus (Alpha Boötis) and star 36 Vega (Alpha Lyrae). His sighting accuracy was such that the difference in the angle reading was 000.01 degrees. The angles by which the gimbals are rotated or 'torqued' to restore perfect alignment are - 0.283&deg; in X, - 0.161&deg; in Y and 0.403&deg; in Z.
023:54:59|An orbit around the Moon will have a low point and a high point, each known as perilune and apolune respectively. But an object arriving at the Moon from outside its gravitational sphere of influence has only one such point, the point of closest approach and this is know as pericynthion. Their current calculated pericynthion is much higher than that required to get into their desired lunar orbit so the function of MMC-2 is to bring it down to the desired 60 nautical miles (111 km).
024:16:15|The traditional news report includes baseball scores and world events. Earthquakes had been rattling the Philippines throughout the month - a week earlier, several people died when a stronger quake hit Luzon.
024:16:15|While Apollo 13 did not make massive headlines for their launch, there was one sure topic that dominated the front pages of newspapers - the breakup of the super pop/rock group The Beatles with Paul McCartney departing from the band to start a solo career.
024:17:26|Like so many things in NASA, everything seemed to get an acronym which immediately became a word. In this case, the Mission Operations Control Room (or just Mission Control to the rest of the world) was known as the MOCR and pronounced to rhyme with 'poker'.
024:17:26|The West German Premier’s visit to Cape Canaveral was part of a 9-day-long stay in the US where he also visited Texas, New Mexico, Camp David, and Washington DC. The speculation presented is valid - by December, first treaties had been signed with the Soviet Union, taking steps towards normalizing diplomatic relationships between West Germany and the Eastern Bloc.

024:18:59|In the event, there was a major and memorable motion picture called <i>Apollo 13</i>. Starring Tom Hanks as Jim, Bill Paxton as Fred, and Kevin Bacon as Jack; with scene-stealing performances from Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly and Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, it came out in 1995 and successfully managed to capture the spirit of the age, as well as telling the story of what Apollo 13 would become.
024:18:59|Billy Casper would go on to win the Master’s golf tournament on April 13th.
024:20:18|Swigert's bachelor status was near legendary, even in contemporary times. The prime CMP Ken Mattingly was single as well, incidentally, but did not enjoy similar notoriety.
024:20:36|Tom Stafford was the head of the Astronaut Office at the time, having inherited the job from Alan Shepard, now back in active duty and training for Apollo 14.
024:20:50|Astronaut,Colonel James A. McDivitt was a Manager of the Apollo Program at the time. He had moved behind the desk after successfully testing the Lunar Module in Earth Orbit in 1969 on Apollo 9.
024:22:03|<b>Time of ignition:</b> 35 hours, 00 minutes.<br> <b>Delta-V:</b> 7,883 feet per second ( 2,388.11 metres/second). This is a maximum specified value.<br> <b>Longitude of splashdown:</b> 155&deg; west; <br> <b>Time of Entry Interface:</b> 069 hours, 54 minutes GET.
024:22:39|This PAD was one of a set of four PADs read up at 012:01:24. Each represented a get-you-home ticket with different ignition times.
024:42:14|Each dosimeter is set to start from a different numeric value, so as to make interpreting them easier. Having all of them give out very similar numbers could cause confusion. This is eliminated via a simple trick such as this.
024:42:42|This reading represents the pressure difference across the forward hatch of the CM. It therefore really represents the difference in pressure between the CM cabin and the short tunnel that runs between the CM and LM. If the absolute pressure in the CM is 5.5 psi [37.9 kPa], then the tunnel is likely to be at 4.85 psi [33.4 kPa] absolute.
025:11:43|The questions were pre-printed onto the Flight Plan, with a few additions read to them earlier over the radio.
025:16:39|As the S-IVB operates, there is a point where the mixture ratio of the propellants is changed to help maximise their utilisation. This is achieved with the operation of a 'propellant utilisation' or PU valve and usually, the crews could feel the change in thrust caused by its operation, the so-called 'PU shift'.
025:17:06|A meter in front of the left seat (commander's position) is normally used to indicate the combustion pressure in the SPS engine. During ascent on the Saturn V, it has a different function where it indicates the aerodynamic angle of attack of the vehicle as it ascends. Its information is derived from air pressure measurements across a series of eight holes at the tip of the Launch Escape Tower. According to the Saturn V Flight Manual, this reading should not exceed 25% to 50%.
025:27:00|The reason for the centre engine early cut-off was ascribed to the S-II's LOX tank being at a slightly low pressure. As far as the engineers were concerned, this pressure was within acceptable limits but as it turned out, it was low enough to cause cavitation within the LOX turbopump of the centre engine.
025:27:00|Cavitation is when a pump's mechanism is raising pressure so aggresively that bubbles form on the low-pressure side of active surfaces. A good example is a boat's propeller which is often seen to produce cavitation bubbles on one side of each blade. Having formed, these bubbles can implode violently, their shock waves damaging the surface. For the LOX turbopump, the problem they presented was that they reduced the effectiveness of the pump, thereby causing a drop in the engine's thrust. Had the supply pressure been just slightly higher, the inducer and impeller would have been able to do their jobs properly.
025:27:00|The change in thrust caused by the cavitation fed back to other resonant mechanisms in the stage; the LOX supply duct, the flexing of the crossbeam support of the engine, the collapse of the cavitation bubbles and subsequent rise in thrust. This created a vicious circle that led to the engine moving back and forth on its flexing crossbeams by 'inches' and experiencing &plusmn;33.7g vibration at about 16Hz. The low part of the cycle in the thrust was enough to trip a sensor that was designed to detect excessively low thrust, and it was this switch that sent the command to shut the engine down.
025:28:30|The propellant margins for the vehicle had been reduced by the extra work required to haul the dead centre engine for longer than intended. It meant that with the various randon unknowns in the system; precise values for propellant quantity, engine efficiency, propellant boil-off, the booster engineers couldn't be absolutely sure that the S-IVB would be able to complete the TLI burn.
025:28:30|Engineers often work with probabilities, with the most likely outcome being at the centre of a 'bell-curve' or 'normal' distribution. The mathematics of statistics shows how the width of the bell curve can be defined in terms of standard deviations from the norm. In this case, they were sure that the outcome would lie within the bell curve to three 'standard deviations' or 'sigma' away from the curve's centreline. So to say 'within the 3-sigma margins' essentially meant that the outcome had a probability of success of 99.7%.
026:43:54|We note that the conversions between statute miles, nautical miles and kilometres don't match, implying that PAO has made a small error somewhere.
026:43:54|It is a measure of the increasing confidence that the managers have in their systems and people that NASA has allowed Apollo 13 to depart from the free-return trajectory by quite a long way. This is to allow access to sites that have a greater scientific interest. Prior to Apollo 13, missions kept very much to the plane of the Moon's orbit around Earth and by departing from that plane, they would not gain the full benefit of a gravitational loop around the Moon back to Earth. The assumption is that, in an emergency, there will always be sufficient capability from the available engines and propellant to restore the spacecraft to an Earth return. In the event, with the upcoming loss of the SPS, Apollo 13 will test their ability to use the LM's large descent engine to restore free return and bring them home.
026:43:54|Their initial TLI trajectory is the so-called free return one, where their pass by the Moon will slingshot them back towards the Earth without other intervention. This would mean that a stricken ship would be simply sent back home, and any adjustments to their landing trajectory could be made with the remaining RCS systems and the like.<br> <br>The free return trajectory places great constraints on their lunar mission, however, such as the choice of the landing sites reachable with their approach trajectory, the resulting orbit, and the fuel available for further maneuvers. THe so-called hybrid trajectory allows them to reach landing targets not possible via the free return trajectory.
027:59:54|Jim must be joking about the state of space food during the Gemini program, where they started with a smuggled sandwich (courtesies of John Young) and proceeded to various pastes in tubes and other equally appealing choices. Things have gone forward in leaps since, with a great variety of foodstuffs that attempt to give the astronauts the culinary comforts of home.
028:00:49|The very large and heavy Hycon camera will be installed onto the hatch window to take high resolution photos of the lunar surface. One of its most remarkable qualities is using the vacuum outside to hold the film flat during exposure. To do this, they create suction by hooking up the auxiliary urine dump into the camera.
028:46:56|The signals from the television camera are modulated onto the Earthbound radio carrier using frequency modulation or FM. In the early days of radio, amplitude modulation was the simplest method of sending a low frequency waveform (especially audio) using a high frequency carrier. Simply raise or lower the level of the carrier in sympathy with the It was very prone to interference. For many decades FM became very common, particularly for audio. It is far less prone to interference and can carry a signal with great fidelity. More recently, broadcasting is dominated by the use of digital coding techniques which make much more efficient use of available bandwidth.
028:46:56|Post-Apollo papers on the development of the TV system imply that a digitally encoded system was briefly considered, but no technology mature enough was available at the time - nor it would be for several decades to come yet.
028:51:02|A P30 PAD stands for Program 30, "External Delta-v". In this context, 'external means that the burn is calculated in the guidance computer using data received from the outside, usually in the form of a PAD from which the data is input into the computer for the burn calculations.
028:51:02|The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This PAD is for a small burn to refine the spacecraft's trajectory at the second pre-planned opportunity for a midcourse correction. This will place them on the so-called hybrid, non-free return trajectory.<br> <b>Systems:</b> The burn would be made using the large SPS (Service Propulsion System) engine at the rear of the Service Module, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.<br> <b>CSM Weight (Noun 47):</b> 63,634 pounds (28,864 kg).<br> <b>Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48):</b> +0.96&deg; and -0.23&deg;.

The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform.<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub>, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> Not applicable.<br> <b>H<sub>P</sub>, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> Not applicable.

This figure, Delta-V<sub>C</sub>, is entered into the EMS's Delta-V counter (hence Delta-V<sub>C</sub>) and the value is slightly lower than Delta-V<sub>T</sub> because the EMS does not take account of the engine's tail-off thrust.<br> <b>Sextant star:</b> Star 44 (Enif, Epsilon Pegasi) visible in sextant when shaft and trunnion angles are 135.9&deg; and 28.1&deg; respectively.

The align angles are roll, 288&deg;; pitch, 205&deg;; yaw, 34&deg;.<br> Additional notes in the PAD are that there will be no ullage burn as the SPS propellant tanks are full and do not require their contents to be settled. The burn details assume the LM is still docked and the mass of the LM is given as 33,499 pounds (15,195 kg).
028:51:02|The main parts of the Aerojet SPS engine consist of the combustion chamber, the propellant injector, and the nozzle extension. The combustion chamber is lined with an ablative material. While the engine is fired, the burning off of the material removes heat and protects the structure of the engine. The propellants are stored in four titanium tanks in the Service Module and fed into the engine with a high pressure helium gas system that forces the liquid fuel into the showerhead-like injector. The fuel used is a mixture of unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and anhydrous hydrazine. The oxidizer is nitrogen tetroxide. These chemicals are extremely toxic, and hypergolic. They explode upon contact with one another, which means that the engine does not need an ignition system to work. The propellants simply have to be introduced to one another. This added to the inherent simplicity of the engine design. The same propellant combination is used on all the RCS thrusters in the CSM and the Lunar Module, and in the LM's two propulsion systems as well.
028:51:02|The Service Propulsion System, or SPS, is crucial for the Apollo mission. It will be used for large course corrections, for burning to brake into the lunar orbit as well as to return to Earth after their mission - not to mention to perform abort burns should the mission have to be cut short. As such, its reliability was of utmost concern. The engine was too heavy to be duplicated in its entirely. To add to its redundancy, most of the engine components besides the actual thrust chamber came in pairs, to ensure that at least one of the systems would work and enable them to operate the engine.
028:51:02|Like the engines on the Saturn V, the SPS engine is also suspended on a gimbal that could be used to point the engine nozzle. This was an important function, to maintain the vector (the direction of the thrust) at a desired point. In the very dynamic environment of an engine burn, the weight of the spacecraft changes with every passing moment, and hence the engine's output must be constantly re-pointed to ensure they stay on course. The computer does this automatically during normal engine burns, but the engine nozzle can also be adjusted manually using controls in the Main Display Console.
028:53:41|They performed earlier tests on the EMS accelerometer to see if it has any inherent bias in detection. The instrument has passd the tests without issue.
029:00:36|This is the fourth of Jack's platform realignments. The two stars sighted upon were star 30 Menkent (Theta Centaurus) and star 32 Alphecca (Alpha Coronae Borealis). When comparing the measured angle between these stars and the actual angle, the computer found that Jack was only 0.01&deg; off, a good result. The angles by which the gimbals are rotated or 'torqued' to restore perfect alignment are -0.084&deg; in X, -0.075&deg; in Y and +0.146&deg; in Z. Although the time of the platform was torqued is given as 29 hours GET by Jack, the post-flight mission report has it marked as 028:49 GET.
029:29:40|This was a very rare misidentification of the CapCom by the crew. None of the three regular Capcoms on the rotation generally start their shift by reminding the crew about coming on duty.
029:30:26|They plan to perform the upcoming midcourse correction with the TV on, to broadcast the action to Mission Control.
029:31:28|Last day's joking about Jack's tax report continue.
029:41:00|The EMS contains an independent accelerometer designed to measure changes in velocity along the spacecraft's X-axis. While the spacecraft is coasting, the accelerometer can be tested to see if it has any inherent bias in its readings because, being weightless, there is no change in velocity. Jack enters +100 into the unit's Delta-V counter and leaves it to measure for 100 seconds. Any deviation of the display after that time indicates the bias in its measurements. It is important to perform the test before an SPS maneuver because the EMS can be set up to shut down the engine based on the reading from the EMS accelerometer. Hence they want it to be as accurate as possible.
029:45:46|P40 is the Program 40, designed for calculating engine burns using the Service Propulsion System.
029:46:08|Star 44 is Enif, Epsilon Pegasi.
030:16:16|FIDO controllers are responsible for calculating the spacecraft trajectory. During their coasting flight, any gaseous or liquid materials expelled from the CSM create a propulsive force that causes a minute alteration of the trajectory.
030:28:08|And not just that - if the SPS fails to fire, there is no entering lunar orbit and no landing.
030:29:54|Testing the caution and warning indicator lights is part of the SPS burn checklist.
030:30:28|The two main modes for the comm system are PTT "Push to Talk" and VOX, the latter being voice activated mode. The crew is now going to VOX to have all their hands free for the complex procedures involved with the MCC-2 burn. The control panel has a thumb wheel for adjusting the sensitivity of the voice activated mode.
030:31:08|The VOX is not capturing all of Jim's words, resulting in garbled communications. He will now adjust the sensitivity.
030:32:44|The TV image is showing the PUGS - Propellant Utilization and Gauging System, which is used to adjust the fuel and oxidizer mixture ratio in the SPS engine and monitor its propellant usage.
030:34:37|While Jack - on the Commander's seat, and Jim go through the SPS maneuver, Fred acts as a timekeeper and cameraman.
030:34:52|The SPS engine control gimbals are some of the most high power electrical systems onboard. The MAIN BUS TIE switches will allow them to supplement the fuel cell output with battery power to maintain a stable current.
030:35:04|Jack checks the two alternating current distribution buses. Each should be supplied by one of the Main Buses.
030:35:06|The MAIN BUS TIE switches are on Fred's right hand panel, and hence he is positioned to operate them.
030:35:11|They power up the rotational control system.
030:35:13|They turn off power to the DIRECT mode on the rotational control, where the RCS thrusters are fired without computer input, instead they are energized by turning the hand controller.
030:35:20|Putting the BMAG switches to the middle position means that they select BMAG number 1 to produce attitude error signals, and BMAG number 2 to produce rate signals, to be displayed on the FDAI 8-balls.
030:35:23|Putting the switch to SCS position relinquishes attitude control from the Command Module Computer and transfers it to the Stabilization Control System.
030:35:27|Another series of switches enables power to the Rotational Hand Controller, which will allow them to use it for manual control input, if necessary.
030:35:29|Electric motors run the machinery for pointing the SPS engine nozzle. This is called Thrust Vector Control, TVC for short. Thrust Vector Control allows them to compensate for any changes in the center of gravity in the spacecraft due to fuel depletion from the tanks and the asymmetric mass of the Lunar Module docked on the CSM.
030:35:42|A multipurpose display shows the SPS gimbal angles and allows for manually inputting desired values via two thumbwheels for the pitch and gimbal, respectively. During the launch, these tapemeters display fuel pressure information in the Saturn V booster. This saves much required space on the cluttered console.
030:35:54|MTVC stands for Manual Thrust Vector Control. When the engine firing is controlled by the computer, it also handles the engine pointing automatically. The Stabilization Control System (SCS) provides the manual backup.
030:36:03|Rotating the T-shaped THC gives a signal for the Stabilization Control System to engage manual thrust vector control.
030:36:15|These are the pitch and yaw angles as detailed by the MCC-2 PAD earlier on. The test for the automatic thrust vector control has passed.
030:36:58|They continue to check the thrust vector control displays and the BMAGs in preparation for the burn.
030:37:04|The Gimbal Test is performed on the computer by inputting VERB 50 (Please Perform) NOUN 25 (Checklist - Please perform) and inputting 00204 onto the first line (known as Register 1, or R1) on the DSKY. Hitting PRO
030:37:30|The display scale on the 8-balls can be adjusted for the situation as required.
030:37:51|The DET is located on the CMP's console, next to the 8-ball and just above the engine status lights. Switches on the bottom of the console allow them to set the amount of time to be counted on it.
030:38:53|Two guarded switches are used to power the SPS engine. There are two control systems, A and B, which are usually known as 'banks' in crew lingo. They will perform this very short burn on Bank A only.
030:38:55|The hand controllers are armed, in case manual control is needed. They also set up the tape recorder to store systems data during the burn.
030:40:17|Average G is a function in the computer that calculates the acceleration sensed by the Inertial Measurement Unit.
030:40:46|They are waiting for the computer to request permission to start the SPS engine. They will do this by hitting PRO on the DSKY when their countdown reaches zero.
030:41:10|They turn the gimbal motors off right after the burn.
030:41:12|Residuals are displayed on the three lines of the DSKY, and read the acceleration on each axis.
030:41:44|After reading the acceleration detected by the EMS, they turn it off, as per the post-burn checklist.
030:41:54|They continue to turn off the systems they powered earlier.
030:43:38|The burn was almost spot on, with very small ft/s errors remaining.
030:44:27|The camera is plugged into the onboard power system.
030:44:47|During the previous lunar landing, the brand new colour TV camera was ruined almost at the beginning of the first EVA when it was accidentally pointed at the sun, burning out its imaging tube.
030:45:59|Vance Brand is playing here with the catchphrase of the long-running TV show where people were put into strange or embarrassing situations while they were secretly filmed - up until the ruse was revealed with the catchphrase 'you're on candid camera!'.
030:49:16|The initial golf scores were part of their morning news briefing already.
030:57:26|This large diagram shows the Lower Equipment Bay as well as the equipment used for going to the bathroom while onboard. Whether the crew opted to use the suction device or the bag to relieve themselves, the end product was then piped out to space through hoses and then via a waste dump duct through the skin of the Command Module.
031:07:06|The plan is to attempt to photograph Comet Bennett through the navigational sextant using the DAC 16mm film movie camera. The sextant will be pointed towards the location of the comet by rotating the entire spacecraft to a desired orientation.
031:32:03|The crew is more than eager to hear the results of the midcourse correction in terms of SPS engine performance.
|The second day of the mission of Apollo 13 is well underway. The crew has performed regular maintenance and systems monitoring, and sent the spacecraft on a new trajectory after a midcourse correction that was broadcast live on TV to Mission Control. They are now on a non-free return trajectory which will allow them to reach their targeted landing zone in Fra Mauro on the Moon. Both the crew and their spacecraft are performing without a fault.
031:44:59|Jack's been doing star sightings to determine their position using the onboard optics and the computer. He is still showing great accuracy in pointing the optics.
031:57:00|They had trouble establishing the PTC roll on the night before due to needing to use this 0.375 value to get the proper rate of rotation. This has now been rectified.
031:58:55|Two cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen tanks are located in the Service Module, feeding the fuel cells with reactants for power generation. Both sets of tanks should be drained equally so that should one tank fail, the other tank would be capable of supporting the crew during an abort of the mission and return home.
031:59:22|Oxygen and hydrogen are piped into the fuel cell, where the reaction produces electricity and an outflow of water steam and hydrogen gas. This is piped into the condenser, where the Environmental Control System's glycol/water coolant absorbs heat from the steam and converts it into liquid water. Currently they are noticing an unusual cyclic fluctuation in the temperature in the consender, although it is not considered to be a problem.
032:00:49|Vance's mysterious remark concerns the Inertial Rate Integrating Gyros, or IRIGs. There are three of these mounted in the Intertial Measurement Unit, and they are the actual gyroscopes used to sense their changing attitude. Like all gyroscopes, they have a tendence to drift away from their perfect alignment. This so-called null bias drift can be compensated for. Based on Jack's earlier alignments, Mission Control has computed the compensation, and it is applied over the data uplink into the onboard computer which interprets the output from the IMU.
032:04:26|They plan to use NOUN 88 to point their optics at the Comet Bennett.
032:14:07|The comet observation has been a bust so far. Currently it appears that the Lunar Module's RCS quads are reflecting light to the optics and making it impossible to see the Comet Bennett.
032:18:04|Ken Mattingly has not yet developed German measles, as per the somewhat joking code language used here.
032:22:55|They are switching to using the Omni B antenna instead of the High Gain Antenna.
032:48:37|The Solo Book is an operations plan for the Command Module Pilot to use during his one-man operations orbiting the Moon while his compatriots explore the surface. Many photographic experiments are planned for Jack during this period.
033:12:20|The 3% imbalance in how much the tanks have been drained is not worrisome, but they would still prefer them to be more evenly used.
033:15:06|The PTC rotation has failed to take, again.
033:19:41|Prime Crew CMP Ken Mattingly - known as TK from his initials for Thomas Ken - has come to brief his backup who is now having to perform his part of the mission.
033:24:08|This refers to the RCS quads C and D, respectively.
033:41:29|The stack is still not stable enough for them to consider starting the PTC roll. Doing it while the spacecraft is moving would cause them to wobble around in an unwanted manner.
033:52:38|Vance is referring to the oppressive Big Brother figure in the classic dystopian novel "1984." Their joke is based on the fact that anything that gives their spacecraft any thrust will be instantly detected by the trajectory people in Mission Control due to their extremely sensitive tracking.
033:59:35|The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This PAD is for a small contingency burn in case the crew will not to enter lunar orbit. Instead, the burn would set the spacecraft on a precise trajectory for return to Earth.<br> <b>Systems:</b> The burn would be made using the large SPS (Service Propulsion System) engine at the rear of the Service Module, under the control of the Guidance and Navigation system.<br> <b>CSM Weight (Noun 47):</b> 63,385 pounds (28,751 kg).<br> <b>Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48):</b> +0.97&deg; and -0.23&deg;. These angles represent an initial direction for the gimbal-mounted engine.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b> 72 hours, 24 minutes, 33.08 seconds.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, +212.7 (+64.8); y, -141.7 (-43.2); z, -254.8 (-77.7). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal).<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b> Roll, 148&deg;; Pitch, 316&deg;; Yaw, 50&deg;. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform.<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub>, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> Not applicable. If this abort burn were to be made, the apogee of the resulting orbit would be over 9999.9 nautical miles, beyond the limit of the computer's display.<br> <b>H<sub>P</sub>, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> 22.5 nautical miles (41.7 km). The perigee distance is so low, it intersects Earth's atmosphere. What this really means is that the spacecraft will re-enter.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>T</sub>:</b> 360.9 fps (110.0 m/s). This is the total change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 53 seconds.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>C</sub>:</b> 356.3 fps (108.6 m/s). Using its ability to independently measure acceleration, the EMS can shut down the engine in case the G&amp;N system fails to do so. This figure, Delta-V<sub>C</sub>, is slightly lower than Delta-V<sub>T</sub> because the EMS does not take account of the engine's tail-off thrust.<br> <b>Sextant star:</b> Star 33 (Antares, Alpha Scorpii) visible in sextant when shaft and trunnion angles are 352.7&deg; and 15.0&deg; respectively. This is part of an attitude check.<br> <b>Boresight star:</b> Not available. This is a second attitude check which is made by sighting on another celestial object with the COAS (Crew Optical Alignment Sight).
033:59:35|The next five parameters all relate to re-entry, during which an important milestone is &quot;Entry Interface,&quot; defined as being 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude. Another important point is when atmospheric drag on the spacecraft imparts a deceleration of 0.05 g's.<br> <b>Expected splashdown point (Noun 61):</b> 23.26&deg; south, 165.0&deg; west; in the mid-Pacific.<br> <b>Range to go:</b> 1,147.7 nautical miles (2,125.5 km). To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel after Entry Interface. This would later be decremented based on data from the EMS' own accelerometer.<br> <b>Expected velocity at Entry Interface:</b> 36,172 fps (11,025 m/s). <br> <b>Time of Entry Interface:</b> 166 hours, 54 minutes and 2 seconds GET. This is the predicted time at which the spacecraft would be at 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude.<br> <b>GDC align stars:</b> The stars to be used for GDC align purposes are 31 and 23 (Arcturus and Denebola). The align angles are roll, 288&deg;; pitch, 205&deg;; yaw, 34&deg;.
033:59:35|The PAD includes some additional notes. The SPS propellant tanks are full, so there would be no need to perform an ullage burn to settle their contents. The burn details assume the LM is still docked and the mass of the LM is given as 33,499 pounds (15,195 kg).
034:03:25|Jack is joking that despite Mission Control telling him that Jack's observations are very accurate, they nonetheless update the onboard computer with the ground-generated navigational data.
034:06:05|Their earlier joking aside, if the communications link between the spacecraft and Earth was cut for whatever reason, it would be up to their onboard navigational sightings for the crew to find their way back home.
034:58:42|Two box-like aluminum objects are hidden from the view usually behind a little door panel. These are canisters that contain lithium hydroxide and activated charcoal. The CM life support system circulates onboard air through the canisters, where the carbon dioxide, odors and any potential toxins are absorbed into the chemicals inside. They have a limited lifetime due to the chemical reaction, and need to be changed periodically to maintain a habitable atmosphere.
034:58:42|The core of the Command Module's life support system is located in the left hand compartment. It features equipment to remove the carbon dioxide, odors, excessive humidity and heat from the cabin via the suit loop. This very compact unit is self-regulated and usually requires minimum crew intervention during normal operations.
034:58:42|Judging by the schedule, they are to remove Can 3 from slot A and and replace it with Can 5. Normally each canister is in place for 10 to 15 hours on average. The longest swap intervall of 29 hours is during the single crewmember operation while in lunar orbit, due to only having one person onboard to produce carbon dioxide.
034:58:42|This silent 16mm film shot during the flight of Apollo 8 shows then-Command Module Pilot Jim Lovell hard at work changing the lithium hydroxide canister. This clip offers an excellent view into the Lower Equipment Bay and the proceedings involved in changing the carbon dioxide absorber.
035:05:01|Jack checks the battery charges and the amount of RCS fuel left in each of the four quads.
035:28:29|Despite Vance's best intentions in assuring the crew, it will turn out to be a somewhat big deal indeed.
035:28:29|The Descent Propulsion Engine (or DPS), designed to land onto the Moon, is a rocket motor using hypergolic hydrazine propellant and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer, requiring no ignition hardware. The propellant and oxidizer are forced into the engine using helium pressure, which also simplifies the design by removing the need for the kind of turbo-machinery that is used to pump fuel into the engines of the Saturn V rocket. The DPS, besides compactness and redundancy, also needs to have the ability to be throttled so that the engine output can be modified - crucial for a soft landing on the lunar surface.
035:28:29|Although built to be very well insulated, the supercritical helium, or SHe tank, experiences a certain amount of heat leak. Rising temperature within the tank causes the gas pressure to increase. This is actually part of the design. To gain the helium pressure needed to operate the engine, they simply need to time the landing burn so that the pressure has had the time to rise in the tank. Normally this happens at a constant rate known to Mission Control thanks to the well determined thermal qualities of the tank, but the tank onboard the <i>Aquarius</i> has been behaving out of the norm. The pressure was shown to be rising faster than expected before the launch, although not alarmingly enough to warrant replacement. They launched knowing that the thermal characteristics of the tank are somewhat suspect. Now, concerned controllers want to power up the displays so that the crew can check the tank pressure. A too fast a rise could cause the tank to be vented through a safety valve known as the burst disk, which would disable the engine and cause a definite cancellation of the landing attempt.
035:44:05|Oxygen pressure inside the Lunar Module is almost 1 psi lower than in the Command Module.
036:42:24|All loose particles - whether dust, food crumbles or anything left over from the construction - will float endlessly in microgravity, propelled by the flow of air inside the cabin. The suction effect from the ECS inlets will eventually pull them against the screens set up in front of them to capture these particles. This makes cleaning up easier, and prevents the system from being clogged up.
036:44:51|Vance is referring to a monocular telescope that can be used for sightseeing, both casual and scientific.
036:47:25|They've been fiddling with the hydrogen tanks in order to prevent MASTER ALARMs from interrupting their sleep due to low pressure in the tanks.
037:11:09|The crew plans to sleep without any of the three wearing the communication headsets. Besides potentially being uncomfortable due to prolonged wearing, it is not possible to completely mute the normal radio noise generated by the system operation as well as antenna switching and the like, hence anyone wearing the headset would be prone to waking up.
037:11:09|What Jim here is requesting is that if the crew has to be roused from their sleep prematurely, they can use the ship’s Up-Data Link to trigger the Master Alarm onboard the spacecraft remotely. Known as Real-Time Commands, Mission Control can turn Master alarm on or off via a radio signal. That, besides the tape recorder, are the only onboard systems that can be remotely controlled.
|The third day of the mission of Apollo 13 to the Moon starts with the crew fast asleep. A successful midcourse correction has put them into the non-free return trajectory which will help them to reach their Fra Mauro landing destination. All systems onboard the spacecraft are working normally, and the crew has only attended to normal monitoring and calibration work while coasting towards the Moon. The third day schedule is not crowded at all, and the highlight is to be the televised tour of the Lunar Module, near the end of the day.
|Crewmembers on the later Apollo missions such as 13 were allowed to take turns in wearing their biomedical harnesses. They were uncomfortable for the user, and not having to wear them all the time was considered a welcome relief.
|NASA was already investigating future space station concepts to follow up on the also still upcoming Saturn Workshop, aka Skylab.
|The 1970 space shuttle concept was a fully reusable vehicle that had a piloted booster stage that could fly back to the space center, while the Shuttle continued on to orbit. Both vehicles were to be powered with cryogenic hydrogen/oxygen rocket engines.
|The space tug was envisioned as a multipurpose spacecraft that could perform a wide variety of manned and unmanned missions and reused afterwards. This too, like many other space plans of the time, was only realized as an artist's sketch.
046:43:22|For Kerwin and the rest of Mission Control, it's about five minutes before midday on the 13th of April.
046:43:38|The schedule for the third day, besides the planned LM activities, will be quite light. Program 37 is used to calculate their return home based on data provided by Mission Control.
046:44:32|The personal dosimeter has a display for the radiation count. The crew also has film dosimeters in their pockets, which will be analysed upon return to Earth, and require no action from them during the flight.
046:44:59|Hydrogen for the fuel cells comes from the two cryogenic tanks in the Service Module. There have been some variations in the pressure inside them, and the alarm system has as a result been tripped off several times already. Although nothing dangerous is going on, nobody wants to give the crew jump scares with the alarms blaring off randomly.
047:38:32|<b>Time of ignition:</b> 60 hours, 00 minutes.<br> <b>Delta-V:</b> 6,079 feet per second (1,852.9 metres/second). This is a maximum specified value.<br> <b>Longitude of splashdown:</b> 153&deg; west; <br> <b>Time of Entry Interface:</b> 118 hours, 04 minutes GET.
047:38:32|This abort program, should they need to make a surprise return to Earth, is calculated for engine ignition at 60 hours Ground Elapsed Time. By burning their SPS engine, they would negate their upwards velocity until the gravitational pull of the Earth will start to draw them back, to return at 118 hours and 4 minutes GET.
047:41:00|The quantity gauge consists of two aluminum tubes, one inside the other, within the O<sub>2</sub> tank. A tiny electric charge is passed between them through the liquid oxygen inside the tank. This measures the <i>capacitance</i> of the oxygen which is directly proportionate to the density of the O<sub>2</sub> and hence can be used to measure the amount of cryogenic oxygen inside the tank. For reasons unknown, this system has suddenly stopped producing meaningful information.
047:42:00|The pressure switches turn on the cryo tank heaters automatically, when AUTO mode is enabled, if they detect the pressure dropping below the designated level.
047:42:26|Their trajectory is still accurate enough after yesterday's midcourse correction that further fine tuning is not required. Hence they are updating the computer with the state vector on their position.
047:43:23|The pressure difference between the Command Module and the Lunar Module is currently 1 psi.
047:45:41|The original plan was to check out the LM at the end of the day, but the deletion of the potential midcourse correction has cleared up the timetable, besides the desire to check out the cranky supercritical helium tank.
047:49:20|They have to stop the PTC for the duration of the LM checkout because they will also do a TV show at the time, and need the High Gain Antenna to be pointed precisely at Earth for it.
047:54:55|The logic is rather simple - the fans will likely jiggle the whole tank structure enough that if some sort of a contact issue is to blame for the loss of sensor data, they just might be able to get it back working.
047:57:12|The LM was open to ambient air while on the launch pad, and was allowed to bleed off its atmosphere during ascent. The 100% oxygen from the Command Module has been used to pressurize the LM and the docking tunnel, but they are now planning to let some of the LM atmosphere to flow out into space again in the hopes to purging out any nitrogen that might remain.
047:57:32|Oscillations have been noticed in the fine electromechanics that run the optics. The same problem happened during Apollo 12, but no definite cause has been determined yet at the time. VERB 16 NOUN 91 displays the shaft and trunnion angles on the DSKY. In this case, they would likely be using the second DSKY in the Lower Equipment Bay, next to the Optics station.
048:00:04|To point their optics at the comet for observing it, they use the P52 for the purpose. Although the program usually employs a list of basic stars for the navigational observations, the "Planet" option allows them to input the known location of any object they might want to look at. For this, they use the half unit vectors which are generated by computers in Mission Control.
048:01:33|These three values determine the calculated location of the Comet Bennett in the Basic Reference Coordinate system used in the Apollo Guidance Computer. By inputting them to Program 52, the optics will seek out this point in space - hopefully with a comet in it when they do look at it.
048:06:35|Cycling of the O<sub>2</sub> tank fans has not restored the telemetry from Tank 2 quantity gage. Although a nuisance, it is not considered to be a criticial failure - even noted as a "no sweat" by Gene Kranz in the Flight Director's Mission Log.
048:06:35|A handwritten request in the mission log, apparently in the words of Gerry Griffin, can be found as the last entry for this shift. It reads:<br> <br><b>LUNNEY!! Please improve your handwriting or at least flag significant items so we can go to AFD log and find out wha' happen. Mercy!</b><br> <br>Additionally, the message is signed by an EK (for Eugene Kranz) who added an 'Amen!!' as well as what appears to be MW for Milton Windler.
049:01:26|Jack has started Program 52 to perform another realignment of the IMU platform. He is using Option 3, where the realignment is done in reference to the REFSMMAT being used. VERB 16 NOUN 91 allows him to use the DSKY in the Lower Equipment Bay to display the present angles of the optics.
049:03:18|Some of the jitter has been indeed observed by Jack.
049:04:24|Jack has observed the jitter in the readout, as suspected.
049:06:10|As per the PAO's comments, Gene Kranz was well known for the vests he chose to wear as a sign of his team colors. Alternative vests were worn for parties after a succesful mission.<br> <br>The white vest worn by Kranz during the mission of Apollo 13 is preserved at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC. A write-up <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/vest-apollo-13-gene-kranz" target="_blank">can be viewed here.</a>
049:08:41|This was Jack's sixth realignment of the guidance platform via Program 52 in the Command Module Computer. For this time, Jack used stars 23 Denebola (Beta Leonis) and 32 Alphecca (Alpha Coronae Borealis). The computer is used to maneuver the spacecraft to a position where the onboard optics can be used to spot these stars. By measuring the angle between the sighted stars and comparing the measured angle to their known angle, they can assure the alignment of the platform. Once again, Jack's spotting accuracy was "five balls" or 000.00, meaning that there was no error in his star sightings. The information gained is then input into the computer that will use electric motors to drive the gimbals into their desired position, or torque them. These values were +0.285&deg; X, +0.011&deg; Y and +0.131&deg; Z.
049:46:05|Despite their efforts to stabilize the Apollo stack, there is enough movement that the comet observations are not particularly successful.
049:51:35|The solution for the hydrogen tank pressure issue is to allow the tanks to misbehave during the day for the crew so that they can have a proper sleep without alarms.
049:54:01|These numbers are for correcting errors in the IRIG gyroscopes in the IMU that have developed during their prolonged operation.
050:27:25|Mission Control briefed the crew about their continuous worries over the supercritical helium system on the day before. Their concern is of a level where they have now decided to give the crew instructions on how to read the helium pressure using the onboard instrumentation.
050:30:47|Goldstone is the location of the Deep Space Network antenna in California, used to support the mission.
050:31:56|The SHe tank issue is one of such importance that procedures have already been prepared for dealing with the pressure rise, should it become critical and potentially mission-ending. Mission Control doesn't want to concern the crew too much at this point, or confuse them with procedures that they most likely will not need to use. For now they are telling them that if the pressure is suspiciously high, they will have to activate the telemetry (short-handed to PCM for Pulse Code Modulation, the method of digitally encoding the data into a radio signal). A very high reading might even result in them having to make a very brief burn of the DPS engine in order to expend some of the helium and allow the pressure to drop.
050:34:00|This procedure would be known as the "DPS burp" in Mission Control documents. It amounted to burning the engine for three seconds in order to release the supercriticial helium into the pressurization system from where it could be vented down to an acceptable level.
050:35:25|While Joe jumped into action, Fred has needed a moment to fetch the spiral-bound book that is the Lunar Module Activation Checklist. It has all the procedures needed to start up the LM systems, first to check them up during the coast, then in lunar orbit before they undock and head for the surface.
050:35:25|The normal procedure for the checkup during the coast only includes five steps. They simply open the hatch, turn on the lights and check the oxygen supply in the Descent Stage before taking a look into the Alignment Optical Telescope above the main control console to check whether the optics are clear.
050:35:40|Step 6 starts with a transfer to Lunar Module internal power. This is done by turning the switch in the Command Module to cut the power transfer through the LM umbilical. This operates relays in the Lunar Module's electric power system to switch internal battery power on. Next, Fred is to close circuit breakers to energize some of the power system, for his future needs.
050:40:28|Mission Control can send remote commands to the spacecraft to switch between Omni B and D antennas without the crew needing to intervene.
050:40:54|This step closes circuit breakers to get power to the supercritical helium pressure sensor and the displays in the control console. Because many of these elements require alternating current, Fred also powers up an inventer and puts it on line to conver the 28 volt DC power from the batteries into 115-volt AC power.
050:42:20|Fred should next use the dial on the console to get the correct reading into the digital display on the top of the console.
050:47:24|This amounts to them pulling the breakers open, and hence taking all the power-consuming offline that they activated for the checkout. Pages Activation 3 and 4 have diagrams of the circuit breaker panels to show what they should look like as needed.
051:07:08|The failed sensor is a nuisance, but one they can work with. One of the solutions they've figured out is to keep the contents well mixed with the tank fans. They also desire to infere through the other oxygen tank with a functioning quantity sensor. By knowing that the tanks should drain equally, and knowing how much oxygen is being consumed each hour, they can extrapolate the consumption from tank 2 as well.
051:07:59|According to Kranz' Flight Director's Log, a plan exists to place Ken Mattingly into the second Mission Control room in the building, away from anyone else, should he start showing symptoms of the German measles infection.
052:08:11|The overtly zealous hydrogen pressure sensor has triggered the alarm again.
053:34:59|The display has separate indicators for suit pressure and cabin pressure, respectively. When the crew is unsuited, the 'suit' display indicates the pressure in the suit circuit that is responsible for replenishing the onboard atmosphere.
054:25:31|One curious part of the LM function that was researched for this journal was the question of how the lights were turned on. After all, the LM is unpowered when they entered, but the crew of course requires light to see the switches and buttons they are about to press. This is handled with a solution that turns on the lights when the overhead hatch is opened, in a manner that Apollo 11 CapCom and Apollo 13 Backup LMP Charlie Duke described as "like a fridge door.". With the right circuit breaker left closed inside the LM before launch, opening the top hatch operates a switch that turns on the lights inside the LM.
054:25:37|Swigert sounds amused and delighted to be talking with his Backup crew Commander.
054:47:05|The docking index is an actual physical ruler-like marking on the docking ring. Since the CSM and the LM are free-floating at the time of docking, they may come together at any angle. The display is used to determine the difference from 'perfect' alignment, and is needed later for calculating the transfer of inertial reference angles to the LM.
054:51:33|Rotating rheostats on the Commander's console has controls for changing the lighting intensity.
054:51:33|Fred forgot to turn up the back lighting on the gauges, hence his initial difficulty reading them.
055:02:39|They are using the manual controls to try and point their High Gain Antenna as closely to Earth as possible.
055:09:27|Jack is having some problem getting the High Gain Antenna set up to their liking for the upcoming TV show. This will have some surprising implications later on, when their electrical power system starts to fail.
055:14:16|Fred Haise is seen in the Lower Equipment Bay, with the optics equipment behind him.
055:14:36|Unknown to the crew, none of the major US TV networks were interested in broadcasting the TV show live, despite the good hour of 8:30 pm Central Standard Time. Instead, television viewers get to enjoy baseball, The Dick Cavett Show, and a rerun of 'I Love Lucy'.
055:16:25|The camera is mostly showing Fred Haise's posterior at the time the TV signal reaches Houston.
055:16:40|Fred dives into the Lunar Module with Jim working as the cameraman. Fred's narration is relaxed and amused, obviously enjoying his time in space.
055:20:05|Fred is fooling around with the fish scale on camera. It is another 'H' mission innovation, to attempt to stretch out their PLSS lunar resources.
055:21:38|The PAO's distance numbers have jumped backwards somewhat. The previous value given was 176,171 nautical miles.
055:23:22|The LEVA slips over the space helmet and provides additional thermal insulation, micrometeoroid protection, as well as a variety of sun visors and shades to protect against the unfiltered sunlight.
055:26:16|This view shows the side of the LMP's station. A checklist is pinned between the control console and the raised ACA handrest.
055:27:52|The bag is hung inside the space suit collar.
055:30:21|Even in the middle of the TV show, Jack has to attend to onboard business as usual.
055:34:39|They've managed to carefully line up the camera to show what it can see through the telescope.
055:36:29|Fred is lodged sideways across the cabin to show off his sleep station. In the TV capture, he has his finger on the Push to Talk button on his comm carrier to speak to Mission Control. Just above his right elbow is the cover of the Lunar Module DSKY, with a cheat sheet of computer VERB and NOUN commands!
055:36:29|The controllers are watching the TV show, with Fred on the big screen. The back of Flight Director Gene Kranz is well identifable around the center. To his left, Jack Lousma and Vance Brand watch from the CapCom station.
055:36:50|Fred has pushed his feet under the edge of the stowage assembly to stay put in zero G.
055:39:22|The values for velocity as well as distance are in error at this point. They will come good as the flight progresses.
055:42:13|The probe assembly weighs 92.40 pounds, or 41.9 kilograms. Jim is not exaggrating how unwieldy the device is, especially in normal gravity. It is usually kept strapped under one of the crew couches, out of the way.
055:43:21|Shaving in space was found out to be quite the challenge, with many schools of thought on how to accomplish it. Experimenting continued throughout the Apollo program.
055:44:15|Although Jim suggests that they are playing 'Aquarius' at the moment, the Commander's microphone pics up only fragments of unrelated piano music - most probably Willow Weep For Me, as identified by the transcript.<br> <br>Onboard stowage list notes that five tapes were carried onboard. At least one of them contained a kind of a mix tape of music, presumably picked by the crew to amuse them during the trip. Rumors were rampart at the time that the spacecraft would've been named after the song from the contemporary hit musical Hair. The song definitely was among the taped songs with the crew for their voyage, and was heard on air several times, although not on this particular moment.<br> <br>The crew's relationship with Hair is somewhat unclear. Gene Kranz' memoirs "Failure is Not an Option" suggest that they picked the name inspired by the musical. Kluger and Lovell's biography "Lost Moon" suggests that Jim was not keen on the musical.
|It is about nine hours since the Apollo 13 crew awoke on their third day in space. The mission has progressed much like any other Apollo voyage, with its fair share of minor bugs to test the crew and the flight controllers in Mission Control, all of which are dealt with competently. Jim Lovell and Fred Haise entered the Lunar Module <i>Aquarius</i> earlier to check it over as per flight plan and checked the supercritical Helium situation as well. Later they took a TV camera with them for a transmission to Earth. At this point, there is nothing that hints to the profound problems the CSM is about to endure.
|Flight Director Gene Kranz has gone around the Mission Control stations, asking if they have any business they like to put forward to the crew at this moment. They report to the Flight Director who then relays the requests to the Capcom, who is the only one who is generally allowed to speak up to the crew. All this is done to keep a careful check on the flow of information and procedures within Mission Control. Once various controllers relay their suggestions to Gene Kranz, he passes them over to the CapCom who will send them to the crew.
055:49:14|Jack Lousma is asking Jack Swigert about the comm system configuration used for sending the TV broadcast from the spacecraft back to Earth. This is of special interest to the INCO (Instrumentation and Communications) controller in Mission Control, considering they had trouble locking in the signal earlier before the TV show.
055:50:05|Jack is complimenting the crew of the TV show - perhaps guiltily, since it didn’t air live anywhere on American TV. According to Lovell and Kluge's 'Lost Moon' None of the U.S. networks were interested in the program, and hence only the people in Mission Control saw the transmission.
055:50:31|Telemetry shows that the C-4 thruster is not enabled at the moment, and Mission Control wants it on for the upcoming PTC.
055:51:56|The docking index number indicates that relative positioning of the Command Module and the Lunar module to each other during their current docked condition. This is important information in regards to configuring the Lunar Module’s attitude reference for later navigational purposes. Since both modules were floating free in space during the docking, and the docking system is symmetrical, they could have joined up at any given position in relation to one another. The docking index number is required to be taken into account when calculating the gyroscopic reference angles for the Lunar Module’s guidance system by using the Command Module's inertial platform orientation as the basis.
055:51:56|The next task that Mission Control has for Jack is to have him stir the cryo tanks. This is to homogenise their contents in order to gain a more accurate reading of their quantities. EECOM Sy Liebergot has requested more frequent stirs of the tanks, in particular the two oxygen tanks, because earlier in the day the quantity sensor for tank 2 had failed. If tank 2's sensor can't be trusted, then it becomes important to keep a closer eye on tank 1's quantity and extrapolate tank 2's depletion from that. This is the reason for an evening stir when normally these would only be carried out in the crew's morning period.
055:53:12|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;To the best of my knowledge, Jack, you were in the left-hand seat.&quot;
055:53:12|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I was in the left-hand seat.&quot;
055:53:12|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I was in the LEB, and Fred was somewhere up in the LM. We all heard the explosion together.&quot;
055:53:12|By throwing the switch to stir oxygen tank 2, Jack sends power to a pair of fans via Teflon-shielded wires within the tank. Unfortunately, this Teflon insulation has been damaged prior to flight by excessive heat. The heat was the result of an attempt to boil the tank empty after a ground test. During that attempt, thermostatic switches ought to have cut the power to the tank's internal heaters if the temperature within the tank had risen above 27&deg;C (80&deg;F) but they failed to do so. The reason they failed was that they were rated for the wrong voltage.
055:53:12|When the tank was being built, an important instruction did not reach a company who was supplying thermostatic switches to the tank's subcontractor. Although the spacecraft worked on 28V DC, the ground systems at the launch pad worked on 65V DC. This had changed during Apollo's development and the word had gone out to ensure that all systems could tolerate this higher voltage. The supplier of the thermostatic switches had missed this change. Therefore, when their switches had been called upon to operate and protect the tank after the ground test, the devices had instead been welded shut by the higher operating voltage. As a result, the heaters within the tank carried on operating, raising its internal temperature to around 500&deg;C (1,000&deg;F) which made the electrical insulation within the tank cracked and brittle.
055:53:12|The reason that the heaters had to be called upon to empty the tank was due to the fact that eighteen months earlier, on 21 October 1968, Apollo 13's second oxygen tank was being removed from the Apollo 10 Service Module during modifications. As this operation was being carried out, a bolt snapped and the tank dropped about 5 centimetres, causing slight damage to the fitting that was used to fill and drain the tank. The tank seemed to operate properly and was installed in Apollo 13. Then following the countdown demonstration test on 16 March 1970, the fill/drain system failed to allow the tank to be emptied properly.
055:53:12|Eleven days later, technicians at the pad decided to use the heaters to boil off the remaining oxygen in tank 2 and it is said that one particular technician was tasked to monitor a gauge and ensure it didn't rise above a reading of 80&deg;F, this being despite the fact that 80&deg;F was the highest reading the gauge could display. For eight hours, the tank's innards baked. A second test of the tank three days later repeated the mistake.
055:53:12|Now 178,000 nautical miles from Earth, the cracked and flaked Teflon insulation around the wires finally fails and the wires come close enough to spark. In an environment of pure oxygen at extremely high pressure, the Teflon ignites and a vigorous fire ensues which begins to engulf every flammable substance it reaches. The pressure in the tank rises rapidly until its structure fails and, at 055:54:53 GET, the tank explodes with a force equivalent to about 7 pounds of TNT. As a result the outer skin panel of the Service Module is blown off by a pressure of about 60,000 psi. In response to the force, the spacecraft stack begins to rotate wildly and RCS thrusters fire to restore attitude.
055:53:12|At 55 hours, 55 minutes, 4 seconds, INCO communications data shows that the spacecraft suddenly switches to wide beam communications. A strange crackle is heard on the otherwise very quiet recording of the radio loop, which can be interpreted as a disturbance of the radio link to the spacecraft due to the explosion.
055:53:12|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;There was a dull but definite bang - not much of a vibration, though. I didn't think there was much vibration - just a noise.&quot;
055:53:12|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Just a noise.&quot;
055:53:12|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Probably came through the structure.&quot;
055:53:12|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I felt just a slight shudder.&quot;
055:53:12|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Maybe I was floating at the time; I didn't feel it.&quot;
055:55:28|Although the CapCom is asking for a confirmation of the alarming radio call, in Mission Control in Houston, the flight controllers monitoring the ship have already noticed what they think are erratic readings from the ship’s remote telemetry and have begun to troubleshoot the possible issues.
055:55:28|The telemetry displays in Mission Control are produced by the computers in the Real Time Computer Complex - or RTCC - on the ground floor of the Mission Control building. The TV displays are updated once a second, although many values in the systems are recorded several times per second.
055:55:58|The legendary line delivered by Lovell is “Houston, we’ve had a problem” and not the familiar “Houston, we have a problem” made especially popular by the Tom Hanks movie. The writers of the movie have admitted that they had to use the line expected by the viewers, instead of the historically accurate one, for the sake of drama. This of course has perpetuated the line in the popular consciousness, putting it into the top three of misquoted movies alongside “Play it again, Sam” and “Beam me up, Scotty!” Overall, “Houston, we have a problem” surely counts among the most famous spaceflight-related quotes alongside “A small step for a man, a giant leap for mankind” and “That’s no moon, that’s a space station!”<br> <br>The force of the explosion has had profound effects within the Service Module. Two of the three fuel cell units that supply the spacecraft with its electrical power have been knocked out, causing a temporary dip in the supply voltage. This has been picked up by the Caution &amp; Warning system. The remaining fuel cell, number 2, is still working and it is being fed oxygen from the other tank, tank 1. However, the pipework leading from tank 1 has also been damaged and its contents are now leaking away into space. It will be essentially empty in three hours.
055:56:10|Fred has come up from the Lunar Module and taken his spot in front of the Main Display Console to report on the electrical system. Although both the crew and the mission controllers are suspecting that this is a false alarm generated by spurious sensor readings, the bang is a genuine worry. The power supply appears to be stabilizing, too, hence Fred sounds positive that this might not be anything too serious. The alarm he mentions has been tripping several times during their trip so far, and it generally does not cause the crew too much worry unless they can see an immediate cause for concern.
055:56:40|In Mission Control, Flight Director Gene Kranz is getting the first news from his controllers. Intercom systems allow him to speak to the controllers in the room, as well as listen in on the Air to Ground loop, the principal channel of communication with the crew onboard the spacecraft.
055:56:40|Sensors in the spacecraft systems monitor their status constantly. The analogue electric signals are fed into signal conditioners to process them for the onboard display and caution and warning systems as well as for telemetry, to be radioed to Earth. It would not be the first time for the instrumentation to produce faulty readings, including during this mission. The pressure inducers in the suit loop have given erratic readings earlier, as has the measurement for the quantity of drinking water in the potable water tank. None of these have been crucial for the mission, unlike the current strange readings from the cryogenic system.
055:56:54|The hatches connecting the Command Module to the Lunar Module are open at the moment. The developing emergency situation is prompting them to close the hatches in order to isolate the two spacecraft from one another in case that the trouble is originating in the LM or it has suffered damage, such as a hull breach from an impact.
055:57:04|The previously failed readout has come to life again briefly, as observed by Fred. It is now showing another obviously faulty figure.
055:57:37|The computer has restarted itself, as indicated by a warning light on the DSKY. The sudden drop in electric current into the computer is the most likely cause for the restart due to the explosion.
055:57:37|The optics control panel in the Lower Equipment Bay has three caution and warning lights of its own. The PGNS light has come on due to the computer restart. The red MASTER ALARM would have been illuminated as well.
055:57:44|Currently Commander Lovell is reporting that the high pressure helium gas system used to pump the rocket fuel into the RCS thrusters is showing alarms, as are some of the fuel systems as well. “Barberpole” is a black and white flag in the control console that is used as the fault indicator. These indicators are called talkbacks in the Apollo lingo. A grey indicator means 'status normal', a striped one means trouble.<br> <br>The explosion has caused enough of a shock to close the magnetic solenoid valves in the fuel lines. This has been known to happen under normal flight conditions as well when the Command-Service Module is subjected to sudden, brief accelerations including separation from the S-IVB third stage. It should be an indication to the crew and Mission Control staff that the earlier reported bang was not something small.
055:58:07|Three fuel cells supply all the onboard power. Fuel cells 1 and 2 are connected to Main Bus A, and fuel cell 3 to Main Bus B. The Main Buses distribute direct current DC power to the onboard systems at 27 volts. For alternating current, one or two of the three onboard power inverters are used, which then supply the AC Buses 1 and 2. As per normal operation at the time, Main Bus A powered Inverter 1 connected to AC Bus 1 and Main Bus B provided the DC current for Inverter 2 and hence to AC Bus 2.
055:58:07|Fred Haise sits on the right side couch and also acts as the engineer of the spacecraft. Currently he is reporting that the ship’s alternative current supply has been cut down by the AC 2 inverter bus being unable to supply any power. Fred is trying to get the power back on by changing the distribution grid configuration. AC2 is powered by Main Bus B, which is down.
055:58:29|Jack Lousma is confirming the crew’s report. Now they have an apparent malfunction in three of the spacecraft’s four main power distribution systems.
055:58:33|The limit trigger for MAIN BUS UNDERVOLT is 26.25 volts. If the main bus current drops below that, the alarm goes off.
055:59:38|Five minutes have passed since the explosion. The situation is still entirely unclear.
055:59:38|Several Staff Support rooms flank the Mission Control on the third floor of the building. Additional engineers work there to support the flight controllers in Mission Control. Currently they are busy looking through the telemetry as well.
055:59:38|In Mission Control, Gene Kranz consults with his team to figure out just what is going on with their spacecraft.
056:00:35|Each fuel cell can be used to power either of the DC Main Buses. Normally 1 and 2 feed MAIN BUS A while 3 feeds MAIN BUS B. The initial suggestion from Mission Control is to try and get the power grid back to working order by resetting the connections between the electricity-producing fuel cells and the power system and returning the fuel cells to their usual configuration.
056:00:35|Mission Control also wants them to check the Helium valve on quad Delta. The RCS thrusters do not appear to be firing properly.
056:01:08|As the crew examine the gauges available to them, they are gaining a greater insight into the magnitude of the failure that faces them. They can see that reactants are no longer flowing to fuel cells 1 and 3.
056:03:20|Since joining the Astronaut Corps in 1966, one of Jack Swigert's support duties in the program had been the development of troubleshooting and emergency procedures for the Command Module. As they are now into what is indeed the most serious malfunction ever encountered in Apollo so far, Jack's handbook has become exactly what they need.
056:03:20|Despite their earlier optimism and suggestions that the problem might be somehow tied into the High Gain Antenna onboard Apollo 13, Gene Kranz has a very fatalistic conversation with Sy Liebergot about the spacecraft.
056:03:29|Fred has connected the Battery A into the power grid to boost up their failing voltage and keep their systems running. The ship’s batteries are designed to be used whenever the power usage goes above what the fuel cells can comfortably provide, such as during engine thrust maneuvers. They are also the sole source of electric power during the Earth landing phase after separation from the Service Module. To prop up the power system with the batteries in an emergency situation is a temporary measure at best. Fred switched the battery on moments before EECOM Sy Liebergot was about to request that to be done to stabilize the current.
056:04:19|It is ten minutes since the explosion occurred and the spacecraft was knocked out of its attitude, yet the RCS is failing to bring it under control. The High Gain Antenna is no longer providing a link to Earth so Mission Control are looking for an omnidirectional antenna they can use instead.
056:05:32|Nitrogen is contained inside each fuel cell and is used to maintain operational pressure. The N<sub>2</sub> pressure reflects the oxygen pressure since they are calibrated to be close to one another. Sy Liebergot has requested that they ask for the onboard readouts due to the unbeliavable data coming in through the telemetry that is suggesting that two fuel cells have stopped functioning. But surely that can't be is what they are thinking.
056:05:54|Only a subset of readings from the spacecraft's many sensors are available directly to the crew via their instrument panels. This is because room on the main display console is limited. All sensor readings are telemetered to Earth but the spacecraft's erratic attitude is making it difficult for that data to get through to the displays in front of the flight controllers. The crew can access an additional set of measurements via the Systems Test Meter, essentially just a voltmeter with a range of 0 to 5 volts.
056:05:54|After a measurement has been taken, the resultant signal is scaled to be represented by a voltage between 0 and 5V in preparation to be digitised and sent to Earth. Two multipole switches allow a range of these scaled measurements to be fed to the meter.
056:05:54|While Fred gets to work checking the pressure readings, Gene Kranz in Mission Control worries about their continued erratic motions.
056:05:54|The RCS fuel is carefully budgeted for each part of the mission. They're currently spending more fuel than expected for the translunar coast, doing PTC rotation. The computer has been firing the thrusters almost continuously since the explosion.
056:05:54|Although Kranz dismisses this call from TELMU - LM Electrical, Environmental and EMU Officer - it is hinting at several issues that will come up. Power from the Command Module's Main Bus B is fed into the LM through the tunnel umbilical. The telemetry now indicates that with the power out, the heaters in the LM that maintain critical equipment at constant operational temperatures have stopped working. Usually, when the power transfer is cut, the LM turns on its internal power to supply the heaters, but now that is not the case. Although this could pose a danger to the operation of the equipment later on, for now the Command Module issues are much more time critical.
056:06:44|Fuel cell 3’s oxygen pressure reading converts to 9 psi - much below the operational pressure of 62.5 psi.
056:06:57|The normal nitrogen pressure value is 53 psi, about the same as the oxygen pressure. The nitrogen pressure is used to calibrate the oxygen pressure in the system and to pressurize the electrolyte. To have the nitrogen pressure read zero is highly suggestive that the oxygen press is also down, since the two readings are usually very close to one another. It may also be a sensor problem, which would only add to the confusion.
056:07:01|With the prevailing problems with the electric power system, the RCS and the communications, Gene Kranz turns to EECOM Sy again.
056:08:47|Mission Control is trying to get fuel cell 1 back to function by removing it from the power grid. They hope that putting the power plant into a zero load condition will help it recover from whatever has happened to it. This is a temperary measure, for the fuel cells need to have a load on them to maintain their internal temperature that is essential for their continuous operation.
056:08:55|The act of open circuiting fuel cell 1 is as simple as throwing the switch that applies fuel cell 1 current to Main Bus A.
056:08:57|The sensor that was previously giving spurious readings by claiming the tank content was out of scale high has now started to show that the tank contents are gone. At this point EECOM still thinks that it could be just the power to the sensor lost due to the loss of AC BUS 2 which powers the tank 2 systems.
056:09:07|In this remarkable comment from Jim, he calmly finishes talking about the AC power situation before he announces the terrifying news that he can see something leaking from the ship.
056:09:29|Jim is seeing the leakage from oxygen tank 1. Readers should note that documentaries often illustrate this exchange with 16-mm footage of water being dumped during an earlier flight. No photographs were taken by the 13 crew.
056:09:29|Gene Kranz, the man who landed Apollo 11 on the moon without raising his voice, cannot help but exclaim when the news of the leak come to Mission Control.
056:09:58|The report of the venting is causing further consternation among the Mission Control personnel. Obviously a leak is not something that can be attributed to a mere failure in the ship’s instrumentation. The situation is dire enough that Flight Director Gene Kranz is already reminding his crew that the LM lifeboat option is there, but he doesn’t want them to make things even worse by acting too abruptly or trying to guess what’s going on.
056:09:58|It was getting crowded in Mission Control at the time with both Gene Kranz's team and the upcoming flight control team present, as well as many others. The CapCom station with Jack Lousma in charge was one of the most well populated. Fellow astronauts began to converge, offering help and perhaps also unsure where else to be on such an hour when their long time comrades are fighting for their lives.
056:09:58|The EECOM team considers the possibility that the purge valves in the fuel cells have opened accidentally. They think that powering down the onboard system is something they have to do soon.
056:09:58|It's now 15 minutes since Apollo 13's Service Module exploded. The gravity of the crew's situation is becoming clearer.
056:13:21|The venting of the spacecraft's oxygen supplied is acting like a rocket thruster, constantly pushing them out of their desired attitude. This is then fought by the RCS thrusters. If the attitude goes too far in the wrong direction, it can cause the guidance platform to reach 'gimbal lock', a condition whereby two of the three axes of the gimbals line up, reducing the degrees of freedom of the arrangement from three to two. In this condition, the platform's orientation cannot be kept separate from the spacecraft's attitude and their attitude reference is therefore lost.
056:13:52|The ship’s continuous erratic movements prompt the Mission Control to try and reconfigure the maneuvering rockets to operate on the power from the still functioning MAIN BUS A. The control panel for the RCS rockets allows them to select the power source from either of the main buses.
056:14:46|It is twenty minutes since the explosion. The engineers are coming to terms with the idea that the CSM's Electrical Power System (EPS) is dying. Soon, all effort will be made to reduce the spacecraft's power consumption. Among the EECOM staff, they are wondering whether they have lost oxygen tank 1 pressure as well.
056:16:08|In other words, the crew are to reduce their power consumption by 10 amps in order to be able to maintain the primary systems on the output of the single fuel cell and to take the entry battery offline.
056:16:21|Gene Kranz's reaction to the request of a 10-amp power down was a "phew!" whistle into his headset, in surprise of the stark demand.
056:18:03|It is no wonder that the crew might have trouble locating the emergency plans - not designed for particularly easy access. The so-called “Flight Data File” consisted of several spiral-bound books carried onboard the Command Module, containing all their checklists, flight plans, star charts and various other references they were thought to need during the trip. Their total weight was approximated at 20 pounds of paper being flown to the Moon. All the material had to be taken with them on printed form, in a hard copy, considering they did not have any way to store data onboard or display it on a monitor, for example.
056:18:26|The pages, as printed in the onboard material, were indeed vaguely pink, as seen in the corresponding page from <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/a11csmoc/a11-csmoc-f14-07.jpg" target="_blank">Michael Collins' flown copy of the Command Module Systems Checklist</a>, courtesies of the Smithsonian.
056:18:50|It takes several minutes for the crew to proceed along the powerdown checklist. In Mission Control, the engineers bicker about the possibility of trying to establish PTC to aid with thermal control of the spacecraft. The ship’s erratic movements make it impossible.
056:18:50|25 minutes since the explosion.
056:22:26|They've gone through the first 16 steps on the checklist. The latest step has been to turn the BMAG 2's power down to WARM UP which maintains operational temperature but uses less power than having the BMAG running.
056:22:31|Jack complains that the ship is still moving out of control, and he’s using the manual RCS function to try and stabilize them. He wonders if some of the RCS thrusters are firing on their own, and wonders if Mission Control can tell him anything about it.
056:23:12|Half an hour has passed since oxygen tank 2 blew up.
056:24:42|Mission Control wants to look properly into the status of O<sub>2</sub> tank 2. The sensors measuring the quantity and temperature in that tank draw power from AC Bus 2, an early casualty of the emergency. Mission Control wants to alleviate the situation by switching Inverter 1 to supply alternating current to both AC buses. AC Bus 2 was receiving power via Inverter 2 earlier on, and although one inverter can easily support both AC buses, there is concern that the highly burdened Main Bus A might go to Undervolt again as a result of the new load.
056:25:37|The fuel cells pumps circulate liquid hydrogen in the fuel cell and provide pressurization as well as cooling in addition to glycol in the coolant system loop. They can be turned off for some time to conserve power, but the crew does not want to risk any drop in performance in the remaining working fuel cell.
056:25:37|In Mission Control, Gene Kranz asks the Lunar Module controllers to check their systems and see if their spacecraft could be the one that is leaking after all. Meanwhile, the people monitoring Apollo’s trajectory confirm that they can see the ship deviating from its flight path due to the leak.
056:27:48|The ship has once again moved and Mission Control requests they switch to antenna C for communications.
056:28:29|An initial worry was that a meteor strike had damaged the Lunar Module, prompting them to install the hatches between the craft in a hurry.
056:28:48|Fred is already suggesting that if things go even worse, they can use the lunar module as a lifeboat. Even though it has not been mentioned on air, it appears that both the crew and the Mission Control are considering this possibility. Although he only mentions ‘consumables’, since there is no way to actually transfer them from the LM to the Command Module, this effectively means that the crew may have to take shelter onboard the LM.
056:33:49|EECOM Sy Liebergot has requested that the crew reduces the power load in the remaining Main Bus A so that they will be able to take the reentry battery offline and then use the spare power to troubleshoot the cryo tanks further. To do so, they go through two more steps on the E1-5 power down list, and turn off BMAG 2 as well as cabin lights.
056:33:49|Long pause.
056:34:29|After attempting to recover fuel cell 1 by removing it from the power grid, they are now trying the same procedure on the other malfunctioning fuel cell. Sy Liebergot originally wanted both 1 and 3 open circuited simultaneously, but Gene Kranz suggested they do them one at a time, just in case the configuration change causes problems with the still working parts of the power system.
056:35:26|They want to reconfigure the RCS thruster power again to see if that will help with the continuous issues with the ship moving when they don’t want it to.
056:35:56|Battery A has been connected to the power grid for about 32 minutes to supply extra power after the loss of the fuel cells. Right now Mission Control wants to save the power in the battery, knowing that it cannot be recharged.
056:36:15|Kranz' momentary lapse in recalling the location of the surge tank was not forgotten on his Flight Control team. The post-flight unwinding party included a remix tape of the flight control loop audio where his assessment of "I don't understand that, Sy" was made into the main punchline.
056:37:38|The reason for getting power to oxygen tank 1 is to raise its pressure by switching on its heaters. The oxygen system relies on the source tanks being within a range of pressures. As the gas is depleted, heaters are switched on to restore its pressure. In this case, because the tank is leaking, heating it can only remedy the problem temporarily, and will actually help to empty it faster.
056:37:38|The Command Module has its own small oxygen tank, known as the surge tank, that is used for the crew's oxygen supply during re-entry. By isolating it, they are preserving it for that eventuality, a sign that minds are thinking in the longer term, while the rest of the CSM's oxygen leaks away.
056:39:13|While usually the erratic temperature on a crucial system such as the maneuvering rockets would be the source of much consternation and troubleshooting, compared to the rest of their problems, they are barely blinking an eye on the issue. It is not something that will put the crew’s life in danger for the moment.
056:39:44|Oxygen is normally stored at a pressure exceeding 900 psi (pounds per square inch) within the cryogenic tank. With the leak causing the pressure to plummet, they are attempting to improve the situation by using the tank heaters to turn more of the liquid oxygen into a gas. The pressure has by now dropped to one third of the normal storage pressure.
056:39:46|Jack thinks that in their current state, the power system will be overloaded if they turn on the tank heater, a high-power item.
056:42:03|The tank 1 fans are turned on because the cryo pressure does no show signs of increasing despite the effort to do so by operating the heaters. It is only moments later that Sy Liebergot gives a rather damning verdict on the situation.
056:44:32|A separate circuit breaker panel manages power allocation into the fuel cells and the cryo tank operation systems. Gene Kranz and Sy Liebergot have conferred on the oxygen pressure situation and decided to check the circuit breakers to see if power is really getting to the systems used to try and raise the pressure in the tank. Sy did suggest that they did see the ship’s electric power consumption rise accordingly when the heaters were turned on, hence the breaker theory is very much a long shot.
056:44:32|While the crew is checking whether power is truly getting to the O<sub>2</sub> tank system, Gene Kranz issues the order to prepare the lifeboat.
056:45:55|The oxygen leak is growing weaker because the pressure in the tank has dropped due to the loss of oxygen and the rising temperature. By now a whole cloud of oxygen surrounds the spacecraft and is even visible to telescopic observers on Earth.
056:46:50|Mission Control has told Jack Swigert to shut down the remaining BMAG - this stands for Body-Mounted Attitude Gyro, and the two units form a backup attitude reference system onboard the Command Module. Right now it is an undue power drain, and is simply switched off. In their hurried and slightly confused state, Mission Control forgot to ask to shut both of them down earlier.
056:48:06|Gene Kranz want to know what the crew is seeing on their own instruments. At fellow Flight Director Glynn Lunney’s request, Gene has requested the Capcom to ask the crew to read it all out back to Mission Control and mark it on a diagram of the control panels.
056:48:06|They've barely given out this order when EECOM chimes in again.
056:48:06|The picture above is from another mission. No photos or film exist of the EECOM station during the crisis situation. According to Sy Liebergot's memoirs "Apollo EECOM", the on-site photographers continued to record the expressions and mood in the Flight Control and CapCom stations - sometimes even using the EECOM console as a seat to get a better shot!
056:48:30|Jack is referring to the 8-ball displays, formally known as the Flight Director/Attitude Indicator (FDAI). It tells them their attitude, how fast they are rotating (their 'rates') and it includes needles to help direct them to a desired attitude.
056:49:08|Jim has given them a quick tour of both RCS systems; that on the SM and on the CM. both RCS systems are essentially fine except that having been used heavily to counter the venting, the temperatures of three quads on the SM are elevated.
056:50:02|After the dark prediction made by Sy Liebergot a moment earlier, Gene Kranz sees no option but to lay down the law in regards to the future of the mission.
056:50:02|LM DPS is pronounced "LEM DIPS"
056:50:02|Gene Kranz has apparently written off the engine in the Service Module. They are unsure of its status and whether it could be used to bring them home. The trajectory people will now start to calculate ways to use the Lunar Module's Descent Engine to perform a burn to return to Earth as quickly as possible.
056:50:02|Although the use of the DPS for the return burn will be a triumph of Apollo 13, it is not a mere effort of brilliant improvisation. Planning for the potential use for the LM to produce propulsion for both docked spacecraft goes back at least as early as 1963. The very Flight Plan carried onboard has plans for the use of the DPS should they be unable to enter lunar orbit due to a failure of the SPS engine. None of these plans, however, have been drawn up for a scenario where the Command Service Module is also unable to support the crew.
056:50:57|In Mission Control, Sy Liebergot and his support staff have come to a tremendeous realization about the Electric Power System.
056:56:04|The Apollo 13 crew is just over one hour into the crisis.
056:57:26|Fred’s incredulous response was shared by Jack Lousma, who earlier asked the same questions from Gene Kranz as well.
056:57:48|Fred Haise is apparently unable to believe that Mission Control is indeed telling him to shut down the REAC valves. This is a procedure that cannot be reversed once performed. Hence, NASA has apparently written off one third of the ship’s power production capacity, and Mission Control is effectively scrubbing their mission at the moment, whatever the actual damage the ship might have sustained. It would be against mission rules to continue the mission with only 2 fuel cells, which means that even if they were able to restore the remaining fuel cells to maximum function, the lunar landing is out of the question.
056:57:57|Current thinking in Mission Control is that somehow fuel cell 3 is damaged and causing them to lose their oxygen supply through the fuel cell. Their suggested solution is to isolate the fuel cell physically by closing the valves that control the oxygen and hydrogen flow into the fuel cell.
056:57:57|The thinking for the moment is sound. If they are able to shut down the leak through fuel cell 3, they would have one oxygen tank and at least one working fuel cell in fuel cell 2, enough to get the crew back home safely with power to use and oxygen to breathe.
056:58:40|Jack authored the fuel cell shutdown procedure as well.
056:59:59|The CapCom is meaning exactly what it sounds like - the tape recorder, officially known as DSE or Data Storage Equipment - is used to record systems data during crucial system phases and while the ship is outside communications contact with Earth, so that this information can be passed on to Earth later on. It also has an audio track option, to record what is being said in the cockpit by the crew even when they are not talking to Earth on the radio.
056:59:59|The cockpit voice recorder could even be used to pass clandestine messages to Earth. During the flight of Apollo 8, Commander Frank Borman of the mission fell sick soon after they headed for the Moon. The crew made a recording of his health situation on the audio track of the tape and then asked Mission Control to play back the tape. This way they were able to report on the sickness without using the public radio waves, and cause undue worry in anyone listening in.
057:04:29|The RCS attitude control jets can be fired through two control paths, AUTO or DIRECT, each with their own individual wiring and electric solenoid valves that inject the propellant into the thrusters. In AUTO, the RCS jets are fired according to automatic computer commands based on the computer programming or the crew using various switches on the control console to choose from automatic and semi-automatic control modes. In DIRECT mode, the automatic control is bypassed and moving the hand controller in the Command Module causes the jets to fire under manual control.
057:05:14|Positive pitch rate implies that the nose of spacecraft is tipping 'upwards' in terms of the intertial platform sensing it. By allowing the aft-facing A-4 jet to fire, they are able to push their nose back down.
057:06:12|Although it might seem odd to do so in the middle of an emergency, there is a change of shift in Mission Control. Gene Kranz’ White team is replaced by Glynn Lunney’s Black team in Mission Control, and they continue to troubleshoot the spacecraft’s problems. The White Team isn’t about to just go home for the night. They are soon busy at work trying to decipher what’s going on onboard the ship by looking into the telemetry logs stored in the computers at the RTCC.
057:11:39|Flight Director Glynn Lunney's infamous handwriting becomes even more so as he starts to record the slowly dropping oxygen tank pressure almost minute by minute.
057:11:39|Amazingly, while the crew is still troubleshooting the fuel cells, the PAO is already telling on the continuous radio broadcast the plans to use the Lunar Module as a lifeboat and the way to get back to Earth.
057:12:58|Fuel cell 1's nitrogen pressure is zero, which indicates a sensor issue. Nitrogen pressure on fuel cells 2 and 3 is normal.Oxygen pressure at fuel cells 2 and 3 is abnormal, with three being close to zero at 3 psi.
057:12:58|After observing the situation before taking over as the Flight Director, Glynn Lunney jumps right into action. He has to make some very quick and difficult decisions as soon as he has taken over the Flight Director's seat. With Sy Liebergot also standing down, the on-duty EECOM Clint Burton continues to report on the oxygen issue.
057:14:14|Despite the shutdown of the reactant flow to fuel cell 3, the oxygen tank pressure is still dropping. This is bad news to the troubleshooting effort. There is still a leak going on somewhere.
057:15:04|The ship’s instruments and the mission control use a variety of sensors to calculate the quantities of fuel - not an easy feat in weightless conditions. The quantity sensors and the pressure sensors are supplemented by the temperature sensor, and the temperature data too can be used to determine the state of the tank.
057:15:24|Jack’s comment could be interpreted as a show of disbelief at what he just heard from the Mission Control.
057:16:42|The REPRESS package is a series of three small high pressure oxygen tanks in the Command Module, used for repressurizing the cabin in special situations. They can also supply oxygen into emergency breathing masks to be used in case of cabin air contamination while the crew is not wearing their spacesuits. Mission Control wants to preserve this oxygen source as well. EECOM Sy requested the procedure earlier but it was lost in the general hectic state of Mission Control.
057:18:01|After multiple seesawing back and forth, Lovell and Swigert have been convinced that they have to shut down fuel cell 1 and hope for the best. Their apparent reluctancy to go through with the procedure is another display of the crew's knowledge that the power loss will be final. At best they are looking at an abortive mission with a single working fuel cell, at worst...it can only get worse.
057:20:06|DAP stands for Digital Autopilot. It is a function of the Command Module Computer used for maintaining or changing the spacecraft’s attitude. “BD roll” refers to a routine in the computer that can be specified to use the RCS clusters B and D for roll maneuvers. Roll is a rotation of the spacecraft around its central axis.
057:20:32|Turning off High Gain Power is saving them another 2.9 amps of power drain.
057:20:55|GUIDO stands for Guidance, and figures out how the ship knows which way its nose is pointing. They are also responsible for the onboard computer, and Jack wants to know if they require some action on it.
057:22:05|Verb 74 begins the dump of the computer's erasable 2K word memory to Earth.
057:22:05|The situation has grown very dire, and Glynn Lunney is now questioning the LM people in Mission Control about the plans on how to power up the LM quickly. His hope of a ready solution in one of their checklists that the crew can look up is not to be. However, they do have an emergency operations plan for one kind of a 'lifeboat' mode. This was designed to keep a two-man crew alive in a powered down, stranded LM Ascent stage in lunar orbit while the CMP comes in with the CSM to effect a rescue. The LM lifeboat option for the transearth coast had been investigated over the years and described in detail at least as early as August 1968. it deals with a scenario similar to what TELMU Merlin Merritt proposes here.
057:22:05|The plan preceding even the flight of Apollo 8 as well as the first manned LM flights of Apollo 9 and 10, suggests that in the case of an SPS engine failure, the inert Service Module should be ejected and a return home is made using the DPS engine for the abort burn and the Lunar Module as a lifeboat to support the crew. It also includes plans for transferring power to the Command Module to maintain the onboard computer online. Yet the plan imagines the LM being used for this purpose only for the period following flying past the Moon - while now they are still 24 hours away from that moment.
|Ninety minutes ago, one of the oxygen tanks on board Apollo 13's Service Module exploded after a fire began inside. The crew and Mission Control are furiously getting a handle on what has occurred, how it affects the mission, and now, how they are going to effect a safe return to Earth in a crippled, dying spacecraft.
|What they know so far is that two of their three fuel cells, number 1 and 3, are dead with all their power coming from fuel cell 2. Oxygen tank 2 appears to be empty and from window 1, they can see gas spewing from the SM at the same time that the meter for oxygen tank 1 is showing decreasing pressure. The escaping gas is affecting their attitude causing excessive activity by their RCS thrusters to correct it.
057:24:02|It has been five minutes since the crew closed the oxygen and hydrogen reactant flow into fuel cell 1 with the hopes that this would plug the leak that is depriving them of their oxygen supply, with the thinking that the fuel cell is the source of the leak. Yet the onboard gauge indicates that the pressure in the remaining oxygen tank is dropping, which means that it is still leaking. Pressure has dropped further from 300 psia to 200 psia in just 10 minutes. The lowest acceptable normal operational limit of the oxygen tank system is determined to be 150 psia. Below this, they cannot ensure fuel cell operation. Further system specifications suggest that once the pressure hits 100 psia - which EECOM thinks is only 40 minutes away now - the oxygen pressure in the remaining fuel cell will be too low to sustain any operation and they will be without power.
057:24:12|Jack Lousma’s words are damning in regards to the fate of the Odyssey command module. With the sole remaining oxygen tank losing pressure, there will soon be no oxygen for either power production, nor for breathing by the crew.
057:25:12|The Lunar Module’s usual startup sequence by the book takes several hours and covers 59 pages of procedures for the two LM crewmembers to perform before they can separate from the Command Module and proceed with the landing mission.
057:25:12|This is an important moment to consider. The CSM <i>Odyssey</i> will soon be unable to support the crew in deep space, but the Command Module is hardly useless. It is their only means to get through Earth's atmosphere and return alive thanks to the thick heatshield that covers its skin. They have already secured the oxygen they'll need to the re-entry by isolating two small tanks in the CM, the repress package and the surge tank. They will also need to secure battery power for that re-entry, but people both on Earth and onboard Apollo are aware that an unknown amount has already been spent earlier on as they worked to stabilize the power supply.
057:25:12|Both the crew and Mission Control have come to realise that the Lunar Module <i>Aquarius</i> will have to be used as a lifeboat. It has untapped supplies of oxygen, water and electric power to support the crew, and there are two powerful engines, the most useful of which is the Descent Propulsion System (DPS, pronounced 'dips'). Well-developed plans exist for using the DPS engine to perform an abort burn once they pass the Moon to get them back home - but using the LM also for life support is something they have to figure out.
057:25:12|With regard to guidance, the IMU in the CSM has a valid orientation whereas the LM is unpowered and its own IMU and computer do not function yet. Jack is suggesting he realigns the CSM's platform with the Program 52 routine of the Command Module Computer (CMC) to make it as accurate as possible and then transfer that alignment data to the LM in order to avoid having to align it from scratch. Although a good suggestion, it is not something they desperately need to do under the circumstances. It takes at least 5 minutes even under optimal conditions, and for the moment, whatever inertial alignment data they have is better than not having any at all, which would be the case if the Command Module Computer and IMU lose power.
057:26:46|It may seem odd to be recharging batteries when the ship’s power supply is rapidly dwindling. Yet this is seen as a crucial maneuver. The Command Module, while performing the Earth landing, is powered by three batteries, A through C. These batteries are recharged from the spare output of the fuel cells. With the main power supply gone, the batteries cannot be charged and hence it is possible that they would run out of charge during reentry. The battery charge is not a quick process and hence they can't expect to put much power back into battery A, but for the moment, anything they can put into the reserve power will improve their future power margins.
057:27:13|The time of 79 hours mentioned here coincides with the PC+2 aka Pericynthion plus 2 [hours] burn, a well-developed abort procedure where the engine is fired two hours after closest approach to the surface of the Moon to send them home on a faster trajectory targeted at their desired landing point.
057:27:37|While the decision to initiate preparations to power up the Lunar Module as a lifeboat has been made and told to the crew as well, nobody is sure yet on just how quickly this has to be accomplished. Glynn Lunney is about to find out.
057:27:37|What Burton is saying is that in 18 minutes, there won't be power for anything left.
057:30:44|The waste dump does not deal with crew-produced liquid waste products, but is used to discharge excess water generated by the fuel cells and removed as unwanted moisture from the cabin air. Although the water produced in the oxygen-hydrogen reaction is chemically pristine and used for drinking, washing and food preparation by the crew as well as to cool the spacecraft, the fuel cells produce much more than is required by all these functions. Hence the extra water is periodically released overboard. With the fuel cells soon to be lost, there will also not be any more waste water, and hence a dump now would be superfluous in any case.
057:30:44|In Mission Control, Glynn Lunney proposes one more try to salvage the remaining resources on the Odyssey.
057:30:44|Burton's words are grim. The tank has vented completely out into space.
057:32:44|Despite the attempt at cycling the valves, the display indicates that they are still closed.
057:35:08|The propellant isolation valves on quads A and C are powered by Main Bus B. They are some of the several systems connected to that Bus that cannot be switched over to Main Bus A. Hence, without power to Main Bus B available, the valves cannot be operated and it is more economical to turn off the troublesome quads altogether.
057:35:08|The LM's electric power system is relatively complex. It consists of four main batteries in the descent stage, each with 400 amp hour capacity. Two 296-amp hour batteries are located in the Ascent Stage and power it for the few hours after launching from the lunar surface. Each stage has two Electrical Control Assembly units (ECA) that govern the power output into the spacecraft's two 28-volt direct current power buses. These are called Commander's Bus and System Engineer's Bus. Alternating current (AC) power at 115 volts is produced by two inverters. Two electronic control boxes, the Relay Junction Box and the Deadface Relay Box connect the electrical systems in the Descent Stage and the Ascent stage. The former also contains the relays that need to be energized by the special power procedure earlier on to be able to tap into the Descent stage batteries.
057:35:08|Above diagram shows the flow of the power transfer from the Command Module into the Lunar Module. Switching logic operated by the LM POWER selector in the Command Module sends commands to the control unit in the LM to turn internal LM battery power on and off. Relays K3 and K4 govern this transfer. The LM POWER switch allows the crew in the Command Module to select between the CM-supplied power, which disengages the internal LM power, or low voltage feed from the LM's descent batteries.
057:35:08|Due to the design of the Lunar Module's power system, getting their electrical system running is not as simple as throwing a single switch. In normal LM operation, when the crew enters the spacecraft to begin the power-up, the Command Module is supplying them power from Main Bus B through the LM umbilicals. This power not only keeps the onboard equipment heaters operational during the translunar coast, but also provides power for the switching logic system in the LM. The sudden loss of external power has opened the K3 and K4 relays that govern the power selection system, leaving the spacecraft powerless.
057:35:08|The LM's power system needs to be reset before they can turn it on. Although TELMU initially requested EECOM to provide them with external power by powering up Main Bus B momentarily, they decide to use a special procedure to 'hack' the LM's power system and get them on internal power without the help of the feed from the Command Module.
057:36:12|It is less than two hours since the accident. This is the first time an actual deadline is proposed to the crew on the lifetime left for the Odyssey under fuel cell power. The batteries can sustain for a little while longer, but it is not desirable to spend all of the battery power.
057:38:58|After opening the circuit breakers that govern the power feed into the LM inside the CSM, the procedure moves into the LM. Fred closes circuit breakers on the XLUNAR BUS TIE, which connects the LM's two electric distribution buses together. He also closes two more breakers, ASCENT ECA CONT and DESCENT ECA CONT to enable power into the electric relay controllers that supply battery power throughout the ship.
057:38:58|In order to get power to the Descent Stage's battery control system, Fred is told to select NORMAL SE FEED on BAT 5. Putting this switch to the ON position connects one of the two Ascent Stage batteries into the power distribution system. Thanks to the previously closed XLUNAR BUS TIE, this feeds power also to the Descent Stage control electronics, which are normally tapped to the Commander's Bus and should at this point get their power via the LM umbilicals, from the CSM's Main Bus B. In the case of 13, this power is not available and they need to supply the power from the LM's own batteries.
057:38:58|Fred's next step, with the Descent ECA power available, is to connect the Descent Stage batteries into the power bus. He does this by flipping each of the LOW VOLTAGE switches to the ON position. This enables them to draw power from the LM's main electric power supply in the Descent Stage.
057:38:58|Once done, Fred removes power from the Ascent ECA box, which he no longer needs now that the Descent Stage is taking over. Fred can now proceed with the power-up.
057:39:48|In what looks like a final act of desperation, Mission Control is asking the crew to turn on the fans in tank 2 in the hopes that they might be stirring up some oxygen from the tank and keep the pressure high enough to keep the fuel cell running. They are fairly sure that the contents are gone, but unaware that the actual tank has physically been torn into pieces.
057:41:47|The 'hack' provided earlier has worked, and they can now proceed with the systems activation. Fred's circuit breaker and switch-punching has allowed them to reset the power control boxes to draw electric power from the LM's own batteries.
057:41:47|Lovell and Haise have used the docking tunnel to dive back into the Lunar Module to turn on its life support and power. This is a view looking forward towards the controls and the windows of the spacecraft. The central display console contains the most crucial flight instruments, but there are control panels everywhere in the very small cabin. Two large circuit breaker panels flank the two crew positions on either side, with control panels underneath. Hand controllers for manual flight control input are provided for each crewmember. Equipment stowage takes most of the remaining space.
057:43:27|Jack Lousma reads up advice on how to cut corners in the Lunar Module startup sequence in their onboard Lunar Module Activation Checklist. Since the Lunar Module does not have an active communications system yet, as Jim and Fred had to disconnect their comm cables to enter the LM, hence Jack Swigert has to act as their scribe and pass along the information by shouting it down the hatch.
057:43:59|Activation 1 is the very first procedure in the startup. Step 3 opens the LM Descent Stage water tank valve to provide cooling water, and they also open the O<sub>2</sub> tanks and power up the cabin repress system to ration the flow of breathable oxygen into the cockpit. This is not a full start-up of the life support system, but it will do until they move on to turning on more of the system.
057:44:06|Activation 11 has two parts, step one being omitted for they've already covered it with the previously read up special procedure. Step 2 activates the VHF communications systems as well the Commander's Audio panel in the cockpit. There are also procedures for enabling power to the telemetry system's Signal Conditioner and to glycol pump 2. The latter will start to circulate coolant inside the Environmental Control System's network of piping and cold plates used for absorbing excess heat from within the LM.
057:44:14|Activation 12 concerns mostly with getting the LM's Electric Power System running. They are to close further telemetry and communications circuit breakers and also to provide power to the onboard displays so that they can monitor their newly powered on systems. Step 3 is the procedure to turn on the batteries that supply the LM's power and connect them to the electric buses.
057:44:14|Activation 13 sets up the Lunar Module's own telecommunications systems. Step 1 configures the S-Band radio for operation. The steps they skip are mostly procedures on testing the various transceivers and frequencies by calling Mission Control.
057:44:56|Jack wants to know the warning signs to the impending loss of the oxygen pressure in the fuel cell. Jack poses the question because he has reached the previous deadline for the fuel cell failure and wants to be ready to react.
057:45:15|Two redundant demand regulators pressurize the lunar module by providing oxygen from the LM O<sub>2</sub> tanks and into the cabin at a steady rate. Since the normal procedure for entering the LM would've had them hook up to the suit circuit, they must now instead direct oxygen into the cabin. This will also provide oxygen for the Command Module through the tunnel.
057:45:15|The demand regulator valves are on the right side of the panel, labeled PRESS REG A and B. So far they've also selected CABIN REPRESS - AUTO to have the system maintain the cabin pressure at a constant rate automatically, plus opened the DES O2 to draw oxygen from the Descent Stage tank.
057:47:05|The Mission Control is telling Lovell not to bother starting the VHF radio that is normally used for communicating at the short range between the Lunar Module and the Command module while in lunar orbit. The system does not have enough power to transmit back to Earth and hence it is not seen as useful for the moment. Jim knows that well enough - his Apollo 8 flight included testing to see just how far out they could get from Earth and still use the VHF as a backup to the main communication system. Maximum usable VHF range was determined at somewhere around 34,000 nautical miles.
057:47:05|The PAO makes a slip here. They are describing the PC+2 burn here mistakenly has taking place "near" the pericynthion, the closest approach to the Moon. Yet the burn will happen 2 hours afterwards, well off the pericynthion that is behind the Moon. A Trans-Earth Injection burn would only take place if the spacecraft is on lunar orbit, hence the PAO calling the PC+2 burn is a mistake as well.
057:48:17|At this point it is imperative that the Command Module’s navigational data remains useful, and hence the associated systems must remain powered in the CM. They need to use the battery to make sure that the Command Module Computer and the associated Inertial Measurement Unit are powered so that the data stored in the computer is preserved.
057:48:17|Despite their insistence on keeping the navigational data, it is pertinent to comment that even with their computers and IMU's going offline, this would not have meant that they are lost in space. The LM navigational and inertial sensing equipment could be powered up and used to generate a useful inertial reference for any upcoming maneuvers. It certainly saves them a lot of time at this point to be doing the navigational data transfer now.
057:49:57|It appears that Jack Lousma is reminding Jack not to power down the <i>Odyssey's</i> communication system yet. That would leave them without a way to talk to the crew.
057:51:17|To start with the computer activation, Jack tells them to close the circuit breaker 'LGC DSKY' which will power the Lunar Guidance Computer, the associated DSKY, as well as parts of the inertial reference system that convert the data from the IMU into the digital signals read by the computer. Normally this would be done as part of Activation 22, where a large number of systems are powered. Mission Control only wants to turn on the most crucials systems for now.
057:51:17|Activation 25 powers up the LM computer and the IMU. Step 2 has the operator key in VERB 35 (TEST LIGHTS) followed by pressing ENTER. This command simply tests the computer’s various status lights and the seven-segment display of numbers, and checks the computer itself very briefly. After closing the IMU OPR circuit breaker to get power to the Inertial Measurement Unit, the crewman keys in VERB 37 (CHANGE PROGRAM) ENTER 00 (LGC IDLE) ENTER, to put the computer into waiting mode. The IMU has to warm up for at least 90 seconds before they start issuing commands for it.
057:51:17|Activation 30 is used to set up navigation in the LM by transferring navigation data from the Command Module into the LM’s computer. In Step 1, they make sure that the Command Module is maintaining the spacecraft stack in as steady attitude as possible. They then input the known values of the CM gimbal angles onto the checklist page, and perform the necessary calculations to get the equivalent values in the Lunar Module’s own attitude reference system. On Step 3 they key in VERB 41 NOUN 20 ENTER (COARSE ALIGN GDU’s - ICDU ANGLES) to start inputting the values into the Lunar Module computer. We will be looking at these in detail momentarily when the crew performs this procedure.
057:51:50|Nestled between the two crew stations is the DSKY user interface for the Lunar Module’s own computer, the LGC or the LM Guidance Computer. Like its counterpart in the Command Module, the LGC is used to control the spacecraft’s attitude via RCS firings, control the Descent and Ascent Engines, and to help determining their position. The LGC has additional programming to operate equipment not found in the CSM, such as the landing and rendezvous radars. Although the Lunar Module was constructed by Grumman Corporation as opposed to North American Rockwell, both spacecraft contained a nearly identical Raytheon-made DSKY and AGC as well as the General Motors-built IMU and its associated electronics.
057:51:50|The switches on either side of the control panel are for enabling the hand controllers on either the Commander or the Lunar Module Pilot’s side.
057:51:50|What is to be attempted is much like what Jack suggested earlier. They will power up the guidance system in the LM, get the gimbal angles from the CSM's DSKY, adjust them to compensate for the different orientation of the LM's coordinate system and use them to orient the platform in the LM's IMU. This is normal procedure when activating the LM and because there is room for small errors, for example, taking into account the docking angle between the two spacecraft, it isn't accurate to hundredths of a degree. Hence it is named a 'coarse' align.
057:53:30|The suit fans are part of the Lunar Module’s life support system. By turning one of them on, they are starting to circulate the atmosphere within the Lunar Module. Although they opened the O<sub>2</sub> valves earlier, this only provides them with oxygen in the module. By turning on the fan, the air is circulated through the life support system equipment to replenish it and remove carbon dioxide.
057:53:56|Mission Control is asking Swigert to deactivate part of the Environmental Control System here. The radiators are composed of several rows of tubes braised to the skin of the Service Module. Glycol coolant is pumped through the tubing and heat is hence radiated off the ship and into space.
057:55:56|The fans have not brought any oxygen out of tank 2 and are turned off. They are keeping the fans and heaters in tank 1 running to try and maintain the pressure as long as possible.
057:56:10|The fuel cell pumps were still operating on the still working fuel cell. Temperature problems will not be of concerns for them for the brief time they have left on that cell working.
057:57:28|Fred has reached Step 3 of Activation 25 and input VERB 37 00 ENTER to put the Lunar Guidance Computer on standby. He wants to go on to Activation 30 and start the guidance transfer.
057:58:01|AOS means 'acquisition of signal' and signifies that the LM radio signal has been picked up by the MSFN. They can now communicate directly with the LM.
057:59:23|Jack means Activation 12, step 3 here.
057:59:34|Each LM Descent Stage battery consists of twenty silver-zinc cells connected in series to provide a nominal output of 30 volts. When they are freshly charged and are being loaded only lightly, their output voltage is somewhat higher than desired. To overcome this effect, each battery includes a feed from the 16th cell which will provide a low voltage output for the initial period of its use. This extra low-voltage output is called a low 'tap'. In normal use, once the battery output has fallen by about 10 percent, the crew would switch to taking power from across the entire battery to achieve a higher voltage output where it would remain for the rest of the mission.
057:59:41|Fred has gone through step 3 by flipping the HI VOLTAGE switches to get the full power output from the Descent stage batteries.
057:59:41|The PAO is still desperately trying to butt in to get the by now surely nervous audience up to date with the events of the suddenly very much an exciting mission.
058:00:32|Jack in Mission Control notes that they can ‘see them’, which refers to the fact that the crew must’ve turned on the telemetry sensors earlier on, so that Mission Control can monitor their systems over the S-band radio link.
058:00:39|Fred and Jim checked out the lunar module earlier, and also visited it during the live TV broadcast to show off the lander to their audience. He is now lamenting that they’re back onboard much sooner than expected should the flight have proceeded normally to the lunar orbit. Late Bill Paxton delivered the line to perfection in the Ron Howard movie.
058:00:57|The PAO seems to imply here that they plan to do a burn while behind the Moon. This is not correct, since the most likely abort burn, PC+2, is performed once they have swung around the Moon and are moving away from the Moon again. They are currently also not in a free return trajectory, having burnt the SPS engine during Midcourse Correction opportunity 2 on the second day of the mission to put them on a non-free return trajectory in order to reach Fra Mauro.
058:01:50|They are now turning off the automatic control functions for the Service Module RCS jets. This will prevent them from firing once the LM takes over attitude control. The still running Command Module Computer could interpret this as an unwanted movement and try to correct their attitude automatically. Turning off the RCS heaters of course will save the ever dwindling power in the Command Module.
058:01:50|
058:02:15|Deadband refers to the amount of drift the spacecraft is allowed to have from an established attitude. The autopilot can be programmed to maintain either a narrow or a more broad deadband. Right now Jack is keeping things carefully in check manually to make sure that the guys in the lunar module can input their attitude data into the computer. Any motion of the docked spacecraft between the time the gimbal readings are taken in the CM and the update in the LM will make the IMU alignment less accurate.
058:03:12|Fred and Jim have reached step 3 of the Coarse Align and are now inputting the values for the LM IMU angles they have calculated based on the values read up from the Command Module's DSKY.
058:03:53|Just as Jack is about to remind Swigert about the imminent need to turn on BAT A onboard the spacecraft, things move forward in Mission Control.
058:03:53|The telemetry indicates that the difference in the oxygen pressure and nitrogen pressure inside the remaining fuel is decreasing. Since the two presures should be very similar, he has interpreted this as a sign that the fuel cell has finally reached the end of the line. They need to get the battery into the Main Bus to ensure that they will not suddenly lose power.
058:03:59|Glynn Lunney’s reaction to the news of the battery going online was a paternal “ He got it. Good boy.” - despite being five years younger than Swigert!
058:04:03|This stage in the LM activation process was dramatised in the Apollo 13 movie. Fred has the three gimbal angles from the CSM's IMU which is relevant to the CSM spacecraft coordinate system. He has to do some arithmetic on them to adapt them for the LM spacecraft coordinate system. Those sums include taking account of the 2-degree docking index angle. Given the stress of the situation the crew are in, it is wise of Fred to ask the minds in Mission Control to check what is otherwise simple arithmetic. The actual procedures seen in the movie, with the astronauts writing down numbers on paper and doing the calculations by hand were not exaggarated for the film purposes - this was the standard procedure, albeit performed in a hurry due to the soon approaching demise of the Command Module computer. The harrowed engineers using slide rules to check the calculations was added for extra dramatic effect in the scene.
058:04:03|ACT-30 page of the LM Activation Checklist constains the procedure for transferring Command module inertial guidance information into the Lunar Module's identical unit. Their different physical orientation requires calculations to take place to adjust the values to fit into the Lunar Module's reference system. The crew is offered space to write down both the CM values and the LM values.
058:04:03|No matter what Hollywood says, the mathematical operations are very simple. Inner and Middle gimbal values are derived via a single calculation each, respectively. An extra calculation in modulo arithmetic is required for the Outer Gimbal value, to come to a positive value. No slide rules were needed nor harmed in the exercise.
058:05:19|Fred is looking through the Coarse Align checklist still, at Step 3. VERB 41 coarse aligns the Inertial Coupling Data Unit, which converts the analog signals from the Inertial Measurement Unit into digital data the computer then processes.
058:05:38|The telemetry system can transmit digitally encoded data on either high - 51,200 bps - or low bit rate of 1,600 bps per second. The High rate allows them to send more telemetry data to the ground.
058:06:55|Since they are not wearing space suits inside the Lunar Module, the air flow is directed into the cabin instead of the suit circulation.
058:07:02|These settings put the Odyssey's communications system into a low power mode. Downvoice Backup bypasses the primary signal processor electronics, andd saves some power.
058:08:15|Checking the GET is part of Step 7 of the Coarse Align.
058:10:22|This is the end of the coarse align, with step 8 ready. The LM now has an inertial reference running. Since these numbers are slightly different from the ones given before by Lovell to Mission Control, it appears that the spacecraft has drifted during the time it took them to set up the LM IMU.
058:10:22|The PAO is now giving the time for what will be the PC+2 burn, but they still have the rest of the terminology wrong. They also mention a deep space abort as being one of the options considered. This would mean a very large burn that will basically cause them to start to fall towards the Earth again. This would not be a possibility in the docked configuration. The abort options being considered at this point will be looked at momentarily.
058:12:43|Jack Lousma is telling the Jack onboard the Odyssey to perform three procedures. The first is COMMAND RESET which basically resets any possible remote commands Mission Control might have sent to their systems. Next steps will be turning off the computer and the IMU.
058:12:43|Although the Apollo spacecraft is entirely independent, Mission Control can use the radio and the UP TELEMETRY circuitry to remotely control two systems onboard the spacecraft - the tape recorder, and the MASTER ALARM systems, to alert the crew in an emergency, or to get their attention if they are asleep and not wearing their headphones.
058:14:19|Swigert is already referring to an issue that will crop up later during the mission. The Lunar module has been designed to give life support for 2 people, but now has to provide it for 3. While oxygen is not an immediately concerning issue due to them having an ample supply, there are other issues. The cartridges Jack Swigert is referring to are the lithium hydroxide canisters that are used to absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by the crew. His concern is warranted, considering that an increase in the amount of the gas would kill them. Another issue that they are probably already aware of is the fact that the cartridges in the command module and lunar module are incompatible with the systems in the other spacecraft.. It doesn’t help that the lunar module spare canisters are contained in the Modular Equipmment Carrier Assembly or MESA outside the spacecraft. A duct tape and plastic bag solution will later be produced to adapt the rectangular command module canisters to the round receptacles in the lunar module. Further extra hours could also be had by using the PLSS backpack Lithium Hydroxide canisters which fit into the secondary slot in the LM's life support system.
058:15:07|Turning off the IMU heaters is a momentous decision for everyone involved. Initially, Mission Control hoped to keep the electric heater on to maintain the IMU’s temperature within operational range. Yet it was soon realized that by keeping the heater on using battery power, they would drain all of their remaining power supply needed for the landing. (The discussion over whether the heaters could be used or not was called “Academic” by Glynn Lunney on the flight director loop.) Hence the decision has been made to turn off the heater protecting this delicate instrument, with the hope that it can be restored to full working order later on. Uncertainty existed so as to whether the IMU could handle being powered down to the low temperature to be expected without environmental control. An anecdote told at least in "Lost Moon" by Lovell and Kluge and also in the Apollo computer programmer Don Eyles' autobiography "Starburst and Luminary" suggests that the evidence to the IMU's cold tolerance was based on an IMU being left in a car overnight during winter, and it still worked once it thawed. The Mission Control people were probably aware of this at the time, however.
058:15:11|EECOM telemetry in Mission Control shows that the last functioning fuel cell has finally given up due to the loss of oxygen pressure. It has managed to work for much longer than anticipated despite the pressure dropping way below the expected minimum operational limits. From now on they are drawing power solely from battery A.
058:15:11|Jack has to input several commands into the computer to put it into an idle mode and then power it down.
058:15:11|CMC MODE switch on the Master Display Console removes the computer from the attitude control duties.
058:15:21|Fred is being premonitive again, by speaking aloud issues that will harrow the mission planners as they try to figure out how to make the lunar module’s power, oxygen and water supplies to last until they are back to Earth. Fred’s comment shows that the astronauts’ extensive training and preparations for emergencies means that even under these stressing circumstances, they know what to do. Fred Haise was also assigned to the development and testing of the Lunar Module and its systems, hence he is likely one of the most well-informed individuals in the whole of the Astronaut Corps when it comes to the LM and its performance.
058:16:06|These circuit breakers provide power to various sensors in the Service Module to monitor its systems and produce telemetry data. The systems under these breakers have stopped working already and are hence not needed by Mission Control.
058:17:07|With so many orders coming in, Swigert has to ask the CapCom to hold off for a moment so that he can get himself sorted out. Right now they want him to shut down the Stabilization Control System, the 8-Ball FDAIs, and the RCS automatics.
058:17:58|The sublimator is the LM's chief means of cooling its systems and the cabin. It is so named because it uses the sublimation of water ice into a vapour as its mechanism for losing heat. Water is fed through a set of plates which are porous. On the other side is the vacuum of space. Initial evaporation of the water is enough to turn the remaining water in the plates to ice. This ice then continues to be lost to space, not by evaporation but by sublimation whereby the solid phase turns directly to a gas and carries the waste heat away with it. This keeps the plates in a cold state. Warmed coolant from the spacecraft is fed through separate, closed passages within the plates where it is cooled by the continued sublimation of ice. The outgassing of water vapour from the sublimator creates a very small but not insignificant thrust. In terms of normal LM operations around the Moon, this is not a huge issue. However, by operating the sublimator during a long coast between the Moon and Earth, its tiny effect will have a measurable effect on their trajectory.
058:17:58|They need to have the sublimator started soon. The glycol pumps they have started circulate the coolant through the piping that runs from a series of cold plates that absorb heat from the onboard electronics, the cabin heater and the sublimator. The electronics are not meant to be operated without cooling, and will suffer degrading performance and potentially break down within hours.
058:17:58|The LM's capacity to operate without cooling was actually tested under real flight conditions at the end of the LM's mission during Apollo 11. After Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin transferred into the Command Module, the Ascent stage of the Eagle was jettisoned and left on lunar orbit with her electronics running and the cooling system turned off. Telemetry was transmitted to Mission Control until the systems started to fail, some 8 hours later.
058:18:00|Having two communications systems running, all three crewmembers taking turns speaking to Mission Control and two time-critical procedures running side by side is starting to take its toll here. Jack is turning off all of the Command Module attitude control systems, and is preoccupied, making another request.
058:18:41|This is a rather confused sequence and appears to hint at the dangers of trying to do things too fast. Jack has powered down the guidance system in <i>Odyssey</i> which means there is nothing to feed the FDAI with meaningful information. It's likely Jack Lousma in Mission Control meant to ask the LM crew to power their FDAIs so that the LM's attitude could be watched. The ball in the FDAI is marked with red areas to warn when their attitude is nearing gimbal lock.
058:18:53|Verb 16, Noun 20 allows the current gimbal angles to be displayed on the LM's DSKY, and thereby be monitored from Earth via telemetry.
058:19:45|The Command Module's attitude control and sensing systems are now offline. He still has the Stabilization Control System running, but the BMAGs that could supply backup attitude information have been turned off early on to save power. He has also been told to power down the entire SCS as well.
058:19:56|Fred has removed the spacesuit oxygen hoses and now air flows from the life support system into the cabin and out of it through the CO2 scrubbers, known as the Atmospheric Rejuvenation Section.
058:20:11|The SCS is the Stabilisation and Control System, essentially a set of gyros and associated equipment that allows the spacecraft's attitude to be controlled separately from the primary guidance system, either manually, or semi-automatically without the computer.
058:21:01|The guidance platforms in both spacecraft were co-aligned, roughly speaking, per the current REFSMMAT. However, because of the different orientations of the ships, their attitude with respect to their platforms would be different and therefore the attitude at which gimbal lock would occur would be different. Fred is thinking out loud and realising that Lousma's request doesn't make sense.
058:21:32|Although a complete powerdown checklist is onboard, they are doing a more straightfoward procedure here. First step is to turn off power to the SCS control electronics boxes.
058:21:41|The FDAI/GPI POWER dial is used to turn off the 8-balls and the GPI used to display the SPS engine gimbal angles.
058:21:52|These switches turn off the power supply to the automatic and DIRECT manual control modes in the RCS thrusters. With this move, Jack has powered the remaining attitude control systems in the Command Module.
058:22:23|Fred has proceeded with the start up of the 8-ball by closing the breakers for the FDAI's power supply as well as the GASTA, which is an electronics package that translates the attitude information from the computer or the AGS - Abort Guidance System - for display on the FDAI. Both require DC and AC power.
058:23:00|The four RCS quads on the LM are similar to the system installed on the Service Module, but designed especially for the lunar operations and adapted for installation on the boxy LM instead of the cylinder-shaped Service Module. There are two fuel systems, A and B, and associated Helium tanks that are used to pressurize the fuel.
058:24:16|The problem is, the LM still does not have a properly working attitude control system. The displays are not up, and while the gyro platform appears to be alright, the actual thrusters used to control their attitude are still not started up.
058:26:14|Mission Control notes that they are again moving towards the gimbal lock.
058:26:58|Odyssey’s remaining attitude control systems were powered down five minutes previously, and since then the whole spacecraft stack has been without any active attitude control. Right now they are asking Jack to re-power the hand controllers and use the Service Module RCS thrusters in the manually fired DIRECT mode until the Lunar Module can take over attitude control.
058:26:58|Later on, Flight Director Gene Kranz would admit that this was one of the few blatant operational errors committed by the Mission Control crew during this rapidly evolving part of the mission. Flight Director Glynn Lunney, in charge at the time this happened, described it as a 'low point in morale' when the realization of their mistake came to them.
058:27:12|Verb 16, Noun 20 gives Jim a readout of the gimbal angles, a numerical representation of their attitude with respect to the platform. If the FDAIs are working properly, the 8-balls should show the same attitude because it is their role to give a graphical representation of those gimbal angles. He can see that the two don't match to the degree he would expect them to, and concludes that currently, the FDAIs are not reliable indicators of gimbal lock.
058:27:45|MASTER ARM is a switch that has to be selected into the ON position anytime they want to use one of the spacecraft’s pyrotechnic devices. Fred appears to be at step 4 of the procedure to open the thrusters, which calls for him to open the explosive isolation valves in the RCS Helium system.
058:27:59|Jack Lousma is realizing that things are happening too fast and disorderly. He resorts to giving out turns.
058:28:11|LOGIC POWER provides electric power to the pyrotechnic devices and their control electronics. There are two circuit breakers they have to put in first to enable the power to the system.
058:28:17|There is a panel labeled “EXPLOSIVE DEVICES” on the Lunar Module control console, and the name is no joke. Fuel lines are secured against the hardships of the launch with valves that can only be opened with a small explosive device. This little bang, known as a squib - opens the valves which release extremely high pressure helium gas that will drive the propellant and oxidizer from their tankage into the actual thrusters.
058:28:37|With the control systems still either powered down or in the process of being powered and set up, Jack is resorting to controlling their attitude by looking out of the window and hoping for the best.
058:29:04|It sounds like Jack is having a lot of trouble keeping them steady on this manual control mode.
058:29:25|In their hurry, and following the instructions coming from the ground, the Apollo crew hasn't turned on the inverter that produces the AC power required by the high power equipment of the FDAI and the GASTA. The instructors given will allow them to get Inverter 2 on the line.
058:29:50|It is a moment of relief for the flight controllers to see the AC coming up. They are getting closer to having a spacecraft under proper crew control again.
058:31:03|A pissed off Fred Haise seems to think that the Command Module is still issuing commands to the Service Module RCS systems. Their own RCS is not yet working and once they have it started up, it is possible that the two spacecraft could end up fighting each other for control if both of them fire thrusters at once.
058:31:15|PGNS Attitude Hold will allow the Lunar Module computer to maintain a fixed attitude.
058:31:15|PGNS is pronounced 'pings' by everyone involved. It should not be confused with the near-identical acronym PGNCS, which is the Command Module's primary guidance system. That too is pronounced 'pings'.
058:32:06|The Digital AutoPilot (DAP) was essentially a forerunner of modern digital fly-by-wire systems. Also known as Routine 03 within the computer, automatically fires the RCS thrusters in such a way as to maintain a desired attitude. It had a range of possible operating modes depending on whether the spacecraft was docked, which thrusters were to be used and the size of the deadband, amongst others. These were configured by entering numbers into a register via NOUN 46.
058:32:06|The original plan is to use the "32022" setup on the DAP upon activation, but Mission Control wants them to use "30120" instead.
058:32:06|The DAP configuration is performed by inputting a 5-digit number sequence into the computer. Each digit corresponds to one possible configuration choice in the program. The crew was provided with a checklist that contained all the options possible. The starting digit '3' for example tells the computer to use the DAP in the "'docked' configuration, with the CSM and the LM together. The other digits were used to select the RCS thrusters and fuel systems wished, as well as the desired speed of the motions commanded by the Digital Autopilot.
058:32:06|The code 30120 translates to Ascent and Descent stage docked with CSM, two-jet translation (System A), Normal Scaling (ACA 20 degrees/sec), 5 Degree Deadband, 0.2 degrees/sec automatic maneuvering.
058:32:16|Fred brings up an issue that Mission Control is about to handle almost immediately.
058:32:25|The DAP program needs to know the weight of each of the involved spacecraft so that the computer can calculate the thrust required to accomplish their desired maneuvers. VERB 6 NOUN 47 is used to input the weights of the Command-Service Module and the Lunar Module to the DAP. Although the LM's mass is close to the nominal value in the Activation Checklist, they need to input the mass of a much heavier CSM into the DAP. Their SPS propellant tanks are almost full - only 240 pounds were consumed during the midcourse correction, meaning that they are hauling 40,529 pounds of the propellant with them, much of which would be expected to be used for the Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver, before the nominal LM Activation.
058:32:58|The Stab/Cont panel has switches for selecting manual, automatic, and semi-automatic attitude control modes for the Lunar Module. Currently they want each of the three axes of motion to be in MODE CONTROL which allows the computer to control their attitude. the MODE CONTROL switches below them have two options, either PGNS or AGS. PGNS is the primary guidance system. AGS stands for Abort Guidance System and it is the backup system. Normally it will serve to take over from the PGNS should the primary system fail.
058:33:54|Jim has managed to get the RCS thrusters working in the DIRECT mode. This bypasses the computer control - whenever he moves the hand controllers, a firing signal is sent to the thrusters via alternative wiring, to operate them manually.
058:34:15|Their startup sequence has gotten the Lunar Module computer running, the IMU coarse aligned and the RCS thrusters operational, but they forgot to close the circuit breaker that supplies the ATCA. This stands for the Attitude and Translation Control Assembly, an electronics package that produces the RCS jet firing commands either under orders from the guidance computer or crewman input via the hand controllers. They can't got to automatic Attitude Hold without the ATCA powered up.
058:34:30|This is another of the breakers that would normally go in along with most of the circuit breakers during a regular start-up sequence, but for now they are only putting them in as needed.
058:36:40|Mission Control wants to stop the CM batteries being used further. This quick set of instructions will fully power down the CM.
058:37:15|Jim's voice is heard faintly, caught in the voice-activated radio without him intending to be heard in the comm loop. His tone is rather strained.
058:40:22|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;The emergency powerdown was a very simple six-step procedure. The CM power was completely killed. We pulled all the circuit breakers on panel 250 except the sequence circuit breaker. The CM was like a tomb.&quot;
058:40:22|Jack's final act in the Command Module has been to open the circuit breakers that connect the batteries into the power system. This cuts all remaining power in the CSM.
058:40:22|The accident happened at 055:07:55 GET. It is now 058:40:00 . Three hours and thirty-six minutes after the explosion, Command Module Odyssey has been shut down. Although the loss of the Service Module resources has rendered the Odyssey unable to support its three-man crew in a lunar landing mission, the crucial systems needed for returning to Earth - the parachutes, the heat shield, the computer, thrusters, radios, batteries - are still good to go. The challenge ahead of them is to stretch everything they can out of the Aquarius, up until the moment comes to revive the hibernating Odyssey.
058:40:47|Although they report that the telemetry is working properly, INCO reports a problem with their tracking signal.
058:40:53|Even this early on into this emergency phase of their mission, Fred is conscious of their limited supplies. He wants to turn off the internal lighting on the lunar module control panels to save the trickle of power used by the displays. Running their internal lights for 50 hours could consume just enough power to cut their full life support time by the 1 extra hour needed to get safely to Earth.
058:41:47|While the crew is getting settled in the Lunar Module, now their lifeboat, Glynn Lunney issues a new mission statement to his Mission Control team back in Houston. With the immediate emergency of the oxygen tank failure gone, and the crew in safe quarters for the moment, it is time to look at the very precarious future they are facing now.
058:43:52|Jack first brought up the gyro torquing at 058:24:14 GET. It's taken the crew 20 minutes to get both the LM and the CSM sorted out.
058:45:28|Their next action is to use the numbers read up by Lousma to torque the platform. The small electric motors in the IMU drive the gimbals into their desired position to get the most accurate alignment possible.
058:45:28|The procedure makes many entries into the newly started LGC. First step is VERB 76 ENTER (SET MINIMUM IMPULSE MODE IN DAP) which will ensure that the spacecraft will not make large motions while the gyro torquing takes place. VERB 42 ENTER (FINE ALIGN IMU) starts the process of torquing the platform. VERB 21 NOUN 93 (LOAD COMPONENT 1 IN R1 - DELTA GYRO TORQUING ANGLES X,Y,Z) allows them to input the numeric data into the computer. Verb 21 initially displays to prompt the crewmember to load the X axis value into Register 1. After Enter is pressed, the Verb changes to Verb 22, for loading the Y component into R2, and finally, Verb 23 to load the final, Z component into R3. Once the loading of the torquing angles is complete, Verb 42 is entered again to actually drive the gimbals to their new orientation. Afterwards VERB 16 NOUN 93 lets them monitor the aforementioned alignment process. Once the computer DSKY shows only zeros - ie no difference exists between the desired and the present orientation, the gyroscopic platform has reached the alignment they want.
058:45:28|The LM's Inertial Measurement Unit is identical to the one in the Command Module.
058:48:01|Jack wants to know whether the crew can recognize constellations while looking out of the spacecraft windows. Bright stars in familiar constellations are used as navigational reference points which are used to determine the ship’s position at any given time.
058:48:51|Program 51 is a complete alignment of the platform from scratch with no coarse alignment to get them in the ball park first. Program 52 is a realignment of the platform, on the basis that it is already coarsely aligned, either by having drifted away from its fine alignment or, in this case, having been coarsely aligned by reference to the CSM's alignment before it was powered down.
058:50:02|Mission Control wants to use the Lunar Module Simulator to recreate the visual conditions onboard the spacecraft in order to determine how to perform navigation under the present circumstances.
058:50:02|The Lunar Module Simulator facility. Besides the mock-up of the spacecraft, there is a main control console as well as cabinets upon cabinets of computer equipment used to drive the simulator systems. Albeit stationary and unable to provide motion feedback, every onboard control system and display is simulated to maximum fidelity.. A video system can simulate the lunar surface as well as the field of stars around them or the Sun.
058:50:02|The trio of managers received concerned questions from the press, who inquired on whether the LM had enough consumables to get the crew back home. The managers were confident in that this was the case, and already implied that the Command Module Lithium Hydroxide canisters could be used, and power transferred from the LM batteries into the Command Module.<br> <br>McDivitt was asked to compare this crisis to that of Gemini 8, where a malfunctioning maneuvering thruster caused the mission to be aborted and sent its astronauts Neil Armstrong and David Scott into an emergency landing. McDivitt noted that the biggest difference was that the Gemini mission was able to return to Earth in 20 minutes, while Apollo 13 has many hours to go.<br> <br>Chris Kraft was asked how the situation of Apollo 13 compared to all the previous problems experienced by NASA mission. He was blunt enough in his assessment. "This is as serious situation as we've ever had in manned spaceflight."
058:52:53|As if they didn’t have enough malfunctions, now there appears to be an imbalance in the oxygen supply in the Lunar Module as well - described as “a little problem” by LM controller TELMU at the time. The ascent oxygen tank pressure is up to 901 psi while the normal pressure is 830 psi. Later investigation determined that the Ascent tank valve had developed a reverse leak with oxygen from the already open Descent Stage tank forcing itself the wrong way through, causing the rise in pressure. A mistake in the paper trail detailing the design tolerances for O-ring seals meant that these airtight seals could become damaged and cause such a leak.
058:54:09|The leaking of gas from the Command Module and the debris from the explosion surround the spacecraft. Since every part of the ship was moving at the same speed at the time of the accident, being separated from the spacecraft body does not suddenly leave them behind, but they continue at the same speed, and hence surround the ship as a mobile field of debris consisting of leaked fluids, gas and broken off pieces of the Service Module. This means that the crew is now struggling to start the fine alignment of the IMU via star sightings using the AOT in the LM.
058:54:54|The crew has two manual control sticks at their disposal. The ACA or the Attitude Control Assembly allows them to change the attitude of the ship, ie. make it rotate on all the three axes of motion without applying acceleration to any direction. It is the LM equivalent of the Rotational Hand Controller, or RHC, in the Command Module.
058:54:54|The TTCA or the Translation and Throttle Control Assembly is the second manual controller. It can be used to generate manual firing commands to apply thrust to any direction, hence moving the ship to that direction. The TTCA can also be used to manually throttle the Descent Engine during the lunar landing. It is the LM equivalent of the Translation Hand Controller or THC in the Command Module.
059:00:56|This turns off the Propellant Quantity Gauging System display, used to measure the remaining fuel in the LM's engines.
059:01:09|These displays are used for the onboard time as well as showing information only needed during the lunar landing.
059:01:53|Jim is working to control their attitude from the LM end of the stack while Fred follows instructions to reduce their power usage by turning off any LM displays and other systems that are not needed. Meanwhile, Jack Lousma will read up a maneuver PAD that will hasten their return home once they swing behind the Moon. They will attempt to get it to the crew as soon as possible, should they suddenly lose communications.
059:01:53|One of the flight control stations is named RETRO, short for Retrofire. Their duty during the mission is to come up engine burns that will send the crew back home should it become necessary to abort the flight. The crew has been receiving PAD updates onboard since the beginning of the mission, for the unlikely need for this information. Right now, RETRO has become all too pertinent for the safe return of the crew.
059:01:53|RETRO produced several options for return trajectory very soon after the accident. The first option they looked at was the direct abort, in which they would make a very large burn to negate their forward velocity and begin to fall back to Earth. With ignition time around 60 hours GET, these very large burns would have required the use of the SPS engine in the Service Module and separation from the Lunar Module to be able to produce the sufficient delta-V. These options soon became obviously untenable due to the loss of life support capacity in the CSM, let alone the SPS engine.
059:01:53|The next option was a calculation of PC+2 burn, where the engine would be fired 2 hours after closest approach to the surface of the Moon to hasten their return to Earth. These solutions would make the burn from the non-free return trajectory. The solution chosen to be read up to the crew was one that would result in a landing at the backup landing zone in the Atlantic Ocean This option was given to the crew as soon as possible in case of loss of communications.
059:01:53|Further selection of firing solutions gave other options for the PC+2 burn, with various delta-V requirements and hence varying return speeds. These were calculated with the presumption that an earlier midcourse correction would be performed sometime before the approach to the Moon to alter their trajectory to the free return trajctory.
059:01:53|The direct abort mode requires them to be in the Earth's sphere of influence. This implies that the gravitional pull of the Earth exerted on the Apollo spacecraft is higher than that of the Moon. Around 61 hours GET, they will enter the Moon's sphere of influence and from that moment on, a flyby maneuver going behind the moon on a slingshot is the only viable option.
059:01:53|Mission Control has not made up this procedure on the spot. The so-called PC+2 abort is a known modality that could be undertaken should the Apollo spacecraft be unable to enter lunar orbit.
059:03:56|GDA refers to the Gimbal Drive Actuators, the mechanisms that move the LM's gimbal-mounted descent engine so that its thrust can be aligned with the spacecraft's centre of mass. The two angles given by Lousma are preset values which will place the thrust axis near where Mission Control believe the centre of mass is.
059:03:56|A difference between the LM and CSM is that the CSM's SPS engine axis is parallel to the CSM's roll axis and so gimballing that engine allows adjustment in pitch and yaw. The DPS engine axis is parallel to the LM's yaw axis and its gimbals therefore allow control in pitch and roll. However, the crew, and probably Lousma who is just reading from a sheet, are caught out by the reference to roll.
059:04:56|The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This PAD is for a burn to be carried out two hours after their closest approach to the Moon. Since the point of closest approach to the Moon of a body arriving from outside its sphere of influence is known as pericynthion, then this burn is termed 'pericynthion plus 2 hours' or 'PC+2'. It is a relatively large burn that will set them on a trajectory that returns them to Earth as fast as possible to land in the Atlantic Ocean. In the event, it is not used due to a change in the plan.<br> <b>Systems:</b> The burn would be made using the Descent Propulsion System engine in the LM's descent stage, the engine that was supposed to land them on the Moon.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b> 79 hours, 25 minutes, 26.48 seconds; just over 20 hours from now.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, +1,633.0 (+497.7); y, -14.5 (-4.4); z, -751.5 (-229.1). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal).<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub>, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> Not applicable. The apogee of the resulting orbit would be over 9999.9 nautical miles, beyond the limit of the computer's display.<br> <b>H<sub>P</sub>, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 44):</b> 20.5 nautical miles (38.0 km). The perigee distance is so low, it intersects Earth's atmosphere. In other words, the spacecraft will re-enter.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>R</sub>:</b> 1,797.7 fps (547.9 m/s). This is the resultant total change in velocity the stack would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 8 minutes, 35 seconds.<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b> Roll, 268&deg;; Pitch, 264&deg;. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform. Note that yaw is not quoted. This is because the engine is roughly aligned along the yaw axis and, in LM operations, the yaw angle is at the discretion of the crew and Mission Control.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 86) for the AGS, fps (m/s):</b> x, +1,641.0 (+500.2); y, -14.5 (-4.4); z, -733.8 (-223.7). As the AGS is a much simpler computer, its knowledge of how the DPS reacts is limited. These adjusted values can be used by the AGS in case it needs to carry out the burn.<br> <b>Pitch and roll trim:</b> 5.86&deg; and 6.75&deg;. These angles represent an initial pointing direction for the gimbal-mounted engine. Note that the DPS gimbals are specified to allow &plusmn;6&deg; movement and the roll trim is greater than that.
059:04:56|This burn would have expended almost all of the available delta-V capacity of the Descent Propulsion Engine. This would have made it difficult for them to perform midcourse corrections should they need to. This was a genuine concern because of the uncertainties with the IMU alignment.
059:06:04|The LM like the CSM, has three axes of motion, known as roll, yaw and pitch. The Roll axis (or Z) occupies an imaginary line that goes through the forward hatch of the spacecraft. Movements on this axis are akin to the Lunar Module rotating upside down and then back upright again. The yaw axis (or the X) goes through the Descent Engine bell and the top hatch. Movements on this axis are akin to the Lunar Module rotating around in place, like a ballerine doing a pirouette. The pitch axis (or Y) can be visualized as the LM making a sommersault, either forward or backwards.
059:07:51|The Crosspointer shows their velocities in the lateral and forward axes, and is also indeed only useful for lunar landing.
059:08:01|Since the Descent Engine is not being used at the moment they do not need displays for its fuel pressure and temperatures either.
059:08:12|This turns off the displays for the Communications and the Environmental Control Systems.
059:08:28|This turns off the heater and Electric Power System displays.
059:08:55|PLSS stands for Portable Life Support System, the backpacks used during the moonwalks. PLSS is pronounced ‘pliss’ by the crew. They contain breathing oxygen and cooling water supplies for surviving out in the vacuum.. The water can be drained from the PLSS backpack after an EVA to measure how much water is left inside it. They have bags and a spring scale calibrated to lunar 1/6th G gravity for this purpose. Jim appears to want to use those bags for storing water.
059:09:09|QD refers to quick disconnect, a connector that can be used for transferring water from the onboard supply tanks to a temporary container, generally a plastic bag.
059:09:09|Mission Control is ruminating on how to update the clock onboard the Lunar Module - not a simple task due to the communication troubles. Glynn Lunney has also noticed another comms-related issue in the air to ground loop.
059:09:09|A 'hack' suggests that they should act like a speaking clock , where the CapCom would tell the astronaut "the time is X in five seconds from now" and this is then input by the crew.
059:09:09|Lunney thinks that Lousma should tell the crew that their radio is on Voice Activated or 'VOX' mode.
059:10:25|A strange and unprecedented situation has developed that is hampering the communications with the Lunar Module. The spent third stage of the Saturn V booster, the S-IVB, is pursuing a secondary mission of its own after delivering the crew on their translunar trajectory.
059:10:25|At the top of the S-IVB stage is the IU or Instrument Unit that controlled the operation of the Saturn V launch vehicle. It is still in communication with Earth and, unfortunately, is on the same frequency as the LM as well as being in roughly the same line of sight. It had been expected that both vehicles would be operating at different phases of the mission. Eventually, this clash will be cured when engineers at the ground stations use a larger narrower-beam antenna to carefully detune the LM's unified S-band radio system and pull its frequency far enough away from that of the S-IVB's IU. This state of affairs only needs to last until the S-IVB impacts the lunar surface.
059:10:25|Mission Control plans to deliberately crash the spent rocket stage to the Moon in order to trip the seismographs set up by the previous Apollo missions as part of the lunar surface science instruments package. They want to capture this artificial moonquake in order to learn more about the interior of the Moon by studying how seismic energy passes through it.
059:11:11|The LM has two omnidirectional S-Band antennas (as well as a steerable high gain dish S-Band antenna). They are located fore and aft. As their orientation in relation to Earth changes, they have to keep switching between the antennas, just like on the Command Module.
059:11:59|Verb 55 (increment LGC time) gives Mission Control access to the computer's internal clock.
059:12:46|Jack Lousma is gently reminding the crew that they have the ‘VOX’ mode selected on their radios. VOX stands for Voice Activated, and means that their microphones are set to transmit whenever they speak. Besides Glynn Lunney's earlier suggestion, it is likely prompted by their cussing on the radio.
059:13:42|5 by 5 is radio jargon for perfect reception. They've gone to the PTT or Push to Talk mode, where they have to press a button before the comm line is open.
059:13:46|Astronauts knew that the air to ground feed was monitored and usually transmitted live to the public as well, hence the push to talk button was their way to maintain a semblance of privacy onboard the spacecraft. The tape recorder did include a function to record the onboard conversations, however, for further safekeeping. These private unaired discussions often contained colorful expletives that have later been uncovered to the delight of the space community.
059:13:46|Sadly only limited number of onboard recordings survive from Apollo 13 and they are of the pre-accident period. Turning off the tape recorder was a necessity for saving precious battery power. On previous and upcoming Apollo flights, many intimate and rude conversations were captured ranging from the difficulties with space defecation to a more vocal enjoyment of zero G flight.
059:14:23|Verb 74 begins a dump to Earth of the contents of the computer's 2K-word erasable memory.
059:14:25|A crossfeed allows the RCS system draw fuel and oxidizer from the Ascent Engine tanks, to save up on consumables in the dedicated RCS propellant tanks. It appears now that some pressure from the RCS system has backed up into the Ascent Engine's propellant system, which is not desirable at the moment. The crew gets instructions to close the circuit breakeers to provide power to the electrically oprated valves, which they will then quickly open and close to alleviate the issue.
059:14:25|The valves are called such because they were supplied by the Parker Corporation.
059:18:31|They’re mostly likely not too happy to hear about hurtling down to the Atlantic Ocean. It is not their designated landing area and hence the support system is more limited.
059:20:09|When they hurriedly aligned the LM's guidance platform, they did so based on the CSM's platform, which itself was aligned per the PTC REFSMMAT that was stored within the CM's computer that was in use at the time. Now that the CM has been powered down, the LM's computer, the LGC, does not contain the numbers relating to the PTC REFSMMAT. Mission Control can uplink the relevant data as soon as the crew allows it. It is needed if the crew are to realign the LM's platform. Unfortunately, again due to the hurried nature of the LM's activation, the breaker that sends power to the relevant electronics, the Digital Uplink Assembly (DUA) is open and must be closed.
059:28:03|The downlink system uses only a small amount of power, but still they don’t want it to remain powered.
|Just over 3 hours, 40 minutes have passed since the oxygen tank exploded in Apollo 13's Service Module. In that time, the crew and Mission Control have been coming to terms with the parlous situation they find themselves in and begun the task of effecting a rescue.
|Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert has powered down his Command Module <i>Odyssey</i>. He has little to do now. His crewmates, veteran Commander Jim Lovell and Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise have quickly activated the Lunar Module <i>Aquarius</i> and it is now their lifeboat, providing propulsion, power, oxygen, cooling and other consumables. They are still nearly 20 hours away from the Moon, and only after swinging around it will they start to move back towards the Earth. Although the plan to use the LM as the lifeboat for the return home exists on paper, it has never been practiced by the crews.
|The crew has been passed the details of a burn of the DPS engine that will return them to Earth for a landing in the Atlantic Ocean at 133 hours. That burn would occur 20 hours from now at the so-called PC+2 point.
059:36:25|Houston is trying to determine their exact position and velocity by using the pseudorandom noise, the radio signal that connects the spacecraft to the earth-bound communications system. The resulting location state vector is usually even more accurate than what can be produced by the onboard navigational equipment.
059:41:36|They are discussing the Command Module side hatch here.
059:41:48|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;You might think that you have to stop overboard dump because of the loss of the electric power and the heaters on the urine dump, but Jack actually rigged up the AUX urine dump through the forward hatch and I think he tried it.&quot;
059:41:48|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Jim did it once.&quot;
059:41:48|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;You should tell Houston, too, that dumping overboard was a bad thing to do.&quot;
059:41:48|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;The point I was making was, other than the problems of tracking - I don’t think you need a heater for that overboard dump, and I think you can use it forever and ever without having a heater. With the tracking, though, that made the picture entirely different. When we couldn’t dump it anymore, I think we improvised some place to store all this good fluid.&quot;
059:41:48|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;One comment on using that auxiliary dump for urine is that it does complete cloud up the hatch window. If you ever use that, you might as well forget about photography. We used it for one urine dump, and there were particles on the window from then on.&quot;
059:42:59|Many interesting things in this long message from Jack on Mission Control. Currently on their list of important things is to try to figure out how to fly the unusual configuration while using the Lunar Module’s RCS engines. The are also concerned about the temperature and want to try to reinitiate PTC - Passive Thermal Control by making the ship stack spin in order so as not to keep one side pointing at the sun for too long.
059:42:59|Apollo 14's backup crew consisted of veteran astronaut Gene Cernan (CDR) as well as first timers CMP Ronald Evans and LMP Joe Engle. The latter had the interesting distinction of already being an astronaut before being selected for the Apollo program, having flown the X-15 rocket powered plane to over 50 miles, thus earning him his astronaut wings.
059:42:59|Star sightings are used to configure their guidance system by providing a reference point out in space. By telling the computer where particular stars are located and comparing this with the computer's idea where they should be located, they can determine their attitude and position with high accuracy. This not only helps with navigation, but also allows them to calibrate the inertial platform. Optimally this is done with the onboard telescopic instruments, but now they are contemplating whether it’s possible to do it by eye through the ship’s windows, using backup methods.
059:44:20|The inertial guidance system and the LM computer consume 9.76 amps per hour. Telemetry shows that they are spending 31.7 amps of power per hour overall, meaning that taking off the platform and the computer would cause a drop of a third of their full power consumption. Presently, their power is calculated to last till 124 hours - seven hours short of the projected 133 GET landing, should they stick to the current plan for the PC+2 burn.
059:47:06|John Young is the backup commander of the mission. He has already flown to the Moon on Apollo 10 and has practised much of Jim's role up to the explosion. After Jim himself, he is one of the most experienced astronauts NASA has to offer.
059:59:23|The initial attempt to separate the Lunar Module and the Instrumental Unit’s communications frequencies has improved the communication somewhat, but the situation is still not perfect. A further procedure will be performed later that will rectify the issue properly.
059:59:43|This panel has rotating controls for adjusting the steerable antenna and selecting between the antennas. There is also the signal strength indicator. Currently it reads 2.4 AGC.
060:02:35|They were told to use the Ascent stage oxygen tank earlier due to rising pressure in the tank. This condition has now been rectified and they can return to the much larger reserve in the Descent stage.
060:02:35|This communication problem is caused by the S-band radios used on the LM and on the IU atop the S-IVB stage use the same frequency. On previous flights, the S-IVB's batteries would be spent by this time but on Apollo 13, extra batteries had been added. Engineers wanted to track the stage all the way to its impact on the Moon as part of a seismic experiment that would use a seismometer that had been placed by the Apollo 12 crew. It had been expected that this impact would have occurred by the time that <i>Aquarius</i> was activated. With the early activation, both systems are being received at the same time, causing interference. The engineers at Honeysuckle Creek are attempting to separate the two systems.
060:02:35|The Unified S-Band system works by having a radio carrier of precisely known frequency sent to the spacecraft. This is the uplink. The spacecraft uses it to synthesise a different transmission frequency according to the ratio of 240/221 and this is sent back to Earth as the downlink. By carefully moving the frequency of the uplink, it is possible to also move the frequency of the downlink. The trick in this situation is to discriminate between the S-IVB and the spacecraft, both of which are in the same field of view of the smaller antennae available to MSFN.
060:04:53|They currently have what they assume to be good alignment data, transferred over from the Command Module into the LM’s own guidance system. If they have to shut down the PGNS, they lose this data and in their current situation, they are unsure whether they are able to re-calibrate the inertial guidance using the equipment available to them in the LM. The AOT is only designed for aligning the platform in lunar orbit and on the surface, not in the cislunar space.
060:11:18|Long comm break
060:22:58|Current calculations in Mission Control are showing that at their present level of water usage in the Lunar Module, their supplies will run out around 94:00 GET - only 31 hours from their present GET.
060:22:58|Missions before Apollo 13 used the free return trajectory, where the translunar injection would lead to a lunar flyby that would then swing the spacecraft back to Earth so that in case of SPS failure, the RCS engines could be used to finetune the approach for a safe landing. For the missions after Apollo 12, a midcourse correction changed this approach to one that did not create such a gravitational slingshot. This would enable the Apollo spacecraft to approach the moon in such a manner so as to provide better landing options within the constraints of their fuel supply.
060:22:58|The plan for the moment is to use the DPS engine to do a quick burn to adjust their trajectory so that the lunar approach will put them back onto the previous free return trajectory. Once they got around the moon, they plan to perform the PC+2 maneuver to speed up their return. This would be a different burn profile to the one read up to them earlier, which was calculated with a lunar approach from the non-free-return trajectory.
060:22:58|Should nothing else be done, and the crew be unable to perform any kind of a PC+2 burn or any other maneuver, the free return trajectory will take them to the Indian Ocean for an emergency landing.<br> <b>Landing target:</b> The Indian Ocean<br> <b>Splashdown point:</b> 20.37&deg; south latitude, 60.10&deg; east longitude.<br> <b>Time of Entry Interface:</b> 151 hours, 45 minutes GET.
060:24:30|The proposed burn to return to free return trajectory is not particularly time constrained at the moment, but they of course will want to perform it as soon as possible.
060:25:35|Both the Rendezvous Radar and the Landing Radar are surplus to requirements, given <i>Aquarius</i>'s new role as the lifeboat.
060:25:52|The COAS (Crew Optical Alignment Sight) is a piece of semi-reflective glass onto which a graticule or reticle is projected by a unit mounted to one side. It is normally used during docking operations to help line one spacecraft up with another. It maintains a single line of sight and so can be used as a calibrated aim to sight on stars and therefore provide a rough attitude check. This can permit a P51 (coarse platform alignment) to be achieved.
060:26:14|The Alignment Optical Telescope is a periscope-like device that protudes out of the top of the LM.
060:26:14|The AOT consists of the eyepiece, used by the crew to make star sightings as well as the control box that has buttons for sending signals into the computer once the proper stars have been spotted in the telescope viewer reticle. It is basically a miniature version of the sizeable control console for the optics in the Command Module.
060:26:55|The Earth and the Moon can be used for a rough alignment of the platform, and this option will come up later on in the mission.
060:27:18|The spaceborne navigators have encountered a problem that has plagued everyone who has ever tried to navigate based on star sightings - they are unable to see them at the moment.
060:27:59|Normal rotation maneuvers are made by firing a pair of opposing thrusters positioned either side of a vehicle's centre of mass. This arrangement means that as much of the thrust as possible goes into making the rotation and very little will cause the ship to translate. Only if there is a slight mismatch in the thrusters would there be a translation component. However, Jim is not making normal rotation maneuvers because the thrusters he has to play with, those on the LM, are at one end of a docked pair of spacecraft. At the other end is a 29-ton, fully loaded CSM and there are no opposing thrusters on the opposite side of that. The centre of mass of the stack is well away from his opposed pairs. A roll maneuver is straightforward enough but to achieve a worthwhile pitch or roll (from the LM's perspective), he has to use sideways translation maneuvers. The thrust vector for these translations is sufficiently far from the stack's centre of mass that it imparts a rotation. The problem that Jim is aware of is that these maneuvers will still impart a significant translation thrust to the stack as a whole. Over the long term, such uncoupled thrust will profoundly affect their trajectory, especially important if they intend to miss the Moon by only 60 nautical miles (110 km).
060:28:45|This 127-page document has special procedures for emergency situations, including systems malfunctions, power failures, and other eventualities. Right now they are to go through the 2-hour Activation Sequence and Descent Propulsion System startup to prepare for the burn to change their trajectory. This backup procedure would normally be planned for the situation where the SPS engine cannot be used to brake them to enter lunar orbit, resulting in the need to use the DPS in a short notice. The whole document and the plan they are to undertake is a good show of NASA’s insistence on having the crew ready for most emergency situations that might arise. Although the unprecedented difficulties of Apollo 13 demand some improvisation, for most part our crew on Earth and in space are relying on previously thought out, planned, calculated operations that are in there just for the unlikely situation that they are needed.
060:30:40|Page 1 covers entering the LM, turning on the power, and activating the onboard lights and the Environmental Control System. Fred foregoes doing much, considering they only recently started up the LM.
060:30:47|The 2-hour activation continues with turning on the Electric Power System, and these steps have also been taken already.
060:31:37|The inverter generates 115V AC from the LM's 28V DC supply. They don't want to activate inverter 1 since they are using inverter 2 to power their AC equipment.
060:31:41|The power system is already running and requires no more attention. They skip step 6, which would be a checkup of both of their 2 inverters.
060:34:34|Fred reads out the circuit breakers that are enabled, hence also listing the systems they have powered.Currently they have battery power with AC enabled, the GASTA and FDAI systems, and the telemetry and control systems enabled.
060:35:45|The rest of the circuit breakers control power to the RCS heaters, the EPS fan, the glycol cooling system, and the computer with its associated inertial platform.
060:37:00|DECA is the Descent Engine Control Assembly. It mediates between the control inputs coming from the computer or the crew and the descent engine. This breaker lets the DECA control the gimbals that steer the engine.
060:37:21|They need to power up more electronics to control the DPS engine during the burn.
060:37:21|The main structure of the Descent Stage is an X. The center section is a box with the Descent Engine suspended within on motorized arms. These will be used to vector the engine - to point the nozzle as required.
060:39:03|The checklist has several pages that show the desired circuit breaker configuration in a diagrammatic form. Each page has one of the circuit breaker panels (the left-sided one is panel 11 and the right-sided is panel 16) with the open and closed breakers color-coded into it.
060:39:03|A pushed in - closed - circuit breaker appears black. An open breaker appears as white.
060:40:23|The TCAs refer to the RCS quads.
060:40:46|The LM has its own tape recorder for data and voice storage, named DSEA. They will not power it now.
060:40:52|Despite Jack’s earlier order to configure the circuit breakers as per the pre-printed plan, they are now deciding what kind of changes to do to better suit their current situation.
060:42:04|Jim keeps power in the air circulating fan as well as the RCS quads and the manual control to them.
060:42:53|The VHF radio won't be powered up at any point of the mission.
060:43:04|They will remain using only one S-band transceiver.
060:43:21|The Up Data Link electronics consume only a little amount of power, but they need to save everything they can.
060:43:21|The PAO transcript contains this remarkable announcement from Mission Control at this moment. Although partially in jest, it is also an appropriate comment. It is 2 am in Houston and a lot of people are up past their bedtime - and duty shifts - trying to figure out ways to help Apollo 13.
060:44:59|They will not power the propellant measuring system, nor the Ascent Engine’s helium regulator or the System Engineer’s Crosspointer, which is an instrument only useful for landing on the Moon, not their present activity.
060:45:44|The Caution and Warning system is not powered on. Albeit important, it is not absolutely necessary for the operation of the spacecraft. The telemetry systems are functional and hence ground control can monitor the onboard systems status and alert the crew if they need to intervene.
060:46:14|They will not power up the Abort Guidance System (AGS) at this time. The ATCA breaker provides power to the control electronics.
060:46:43|ATCS AGS breaker provides a backup power supply to the ATCA when being used with the AGS.
060:48:33|They will not power up the steerable antenna, but leave its heater elements working to ensure that the antenna could be brought online should it be needed.
060:49:47|Ascent ECA refers to the Ascent Stage Electric Controller Assembly, and is not powered up. Since they are not using the batteries in the Asecent Stage, their control electronics are not needed either.
060:50:05|Mission Control has determined their position and want to update it in the Lunar Guidance Computer over the radio.
060:50:32|ORDEAL is only used for orbital operations, and is not powered up.
060:52:16|A small army of technicians, engineers and astronauts are in the simulators, trying out procedures that might be useful for the stricken crew.
060:52:37|P30 refers to "Crew Defined Maneuver". In this computer routine, the guidance computer calculates a desired engine burn based on data input by the crew into the computer. The data is provided in the PAD, to be read to them from Mission Control.
060:54:57|The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This PAD is for a short burn to return Apollo 13 to a free-return trajectory. This ensures that the spacecraft will swing around the Moon and be on a trajectory for Earth.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b> 61 hours, 29 minutes, 42.84 seconds.<br> <b>Change in velocity, fps (m/s) (Noun 81):</b> x, -21.3 (-6.5); y, +4.1 (+1.2); z, -31.2 (-9.5). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal).<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> and <b>H<sub>P</sub></b> are both not applicable to this burn as it is placing the spacecraft on a looping trajectory, not an orbit in the conventional sense.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>R</sub>:</b> 38.0 fps (11.6 m/s). This is the total resultant change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 31 seconds.<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b> Roll, 120&deg;; Pitch, 298&deg;. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform and is therefore set using the FDAI display in its inertial mode. Unlike a CSM PAD, yaw is not stated for the LM. Procedures for a lunar landing allowed the spacecraft to yaw around the thrust axis as required for operational reasons.<br> <b>Change in velocity for the AGS (Noun 86):</b> x, -21.3 (-6.5); y, +4.1 (+1.2); z, -31.2 (-9.5). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal).<br> <b>GDA angles:</b> Pitch, 5.86&deg;; roll, 6.75&deg;. These are the angles to which the nozzle of the descent engine will be aimed to place its thrust axis through the stack's estimated centre of mass.
060:54:57|Additional notes include the throttle settings that should be used during the burn. Five seconds at 10% thrust will give the computer time to sense if the GDA angles ought to be trimmed. The rest of the burn will be carried out at 40% thrust. There is also a note to settle the propellants at the bottom of their tanks by burning two of their RCS thrusters for ten seconds, a so-called 'ullage' burn. However, since the system is already configured to use four thrusters, they will soon choose to use that set up.
060:58:52|Several pages are simply skipped since they brought these systems online as part of their startup earlier.
060:59:06|The landing gear is stowed for saving space in the Vehicle Adapter section on top of the S-IVB stage. To deploy them, the crew must energize the associated pyrotechnic devices, their control electronics, and the fire the charges that are used to push the gear into position.
060:59:06|The pyrotechnics push the gear into position and lock them into place.
061:00:39|Their guidance system has been updated earlier to set up the computer to navigate in the cislunar space using the PTC REFSMMAT, and hence no further updates are needed at this point before the engine burn.
061:02:27|This refers to the T-shaped TTCA hand controller on Jim's (left) side of the cockpit.
061:04:20|They are concerned that their recently attained stable attitude will be lost if the computer starts firing the RCS jets automatically.
061:05:42|Repeated simulations before the mission throw a wide range of possible failure scenarios at the crew and flight controllers in order to test their response to the situation. Lousma's joke is that this is like a particularly difficult simulation. Of course, it is no simulation and the lives of the crew really are in the balance if the team does not get this right.
061:07:06|They decide to use the automatic maneuver mode after all.
061:09:05|The DAP is the Digital AutoPilot, a routine in the computer that works to maintain the spacecraft in a desired attitude. It is configured by placing digits into a register in the computer.
061:09:05|They are changing from a DAP load of '30120' into '32021'. As per the configuration guide, they are changing to a 4-jet RCS configuration, fine scale, and a rate selection of .5 degrees per second.
061:12:34|The DPS has a dual system for pressurization. For the first start, they use the pyrotechnic detonator to open the line to a small bottle of gaseous helium - known as the ambient helium tank. This high pressure gas is used for the initial pressurization of the system. This is done to prevent the lines from being frozen by the sudden introduction of the extremely cold supercritical helium which will be the main source of system pressurization. Some 1.3 seconds after engine start, the engine controller will automatically send a signal to the pyrotechnics to fire the explosive isolation valve to open the supercriticial helium line. This begins the primary pressurization.
061:13:47|Since the RCS checkout procedure assumes that they have newly started the maneuvering jets, there's no point to do test firings on them now because they already went through a lot of use while they attempted to stabilize the LM-CSM stack.
061:15:58|Very long comm break
061:23:45|Verb 65 inhibits the up and down-facing RCS jets from firing during a DPS engine burn. This is desirable, since otherwise they might be either giving them extra acceleration, or fighting against the thrust of the main engine.
061:24:38|Throughout this exchange, Fred's intimate knowledge of the Lunar Module, its systems and how they are meant to work is very apparent. Fred was not wrong in his assumption that the abort system should be left unpowered, lest they experienced an accidental separation of the two halves of the Lunar Module - with the loss of their consumables needed for the journey home.
061:25:23|Page 17 of the 2-hour checklist shows various procedures to configure the systems for engine firing. Here they modify the plan to use manual throttle instead of having the computer do so automatically.
061:26:16|Register value 203 indicates that the engine firing control has been transferred to the PGNS computer.
061:27:16|This procedure would lock the engine nozzle so as to prevent the computer from turning it, using Attitude Hold to stabilize the spacecraft, and then use the TTCA hand controller for engine throtling and thrusting.
061:30:25|Albeit the throttle control was set to manual, it was the computer that started and stopped the burn during this short maneuver.
061:30:40|Verb 16 Noun 85 has been entered on the computer. This displays the velocity components still to be gained. In essence, it displays the difference between the velocity change they wanted and what they got, known as the residuals. With the knowledge of what the residual velocities are, they have a choice whether to leave them as they are or to use their RCS thrusters to bring the values to zero, known as 'nulling the residuals', or trimming.
061:33:19|Jim wants them to get the LM's power usage down as soon as possible, to save on their precious supplies of battery power and cooling water. He knows that the computer and the IMU are high demand items and will likely need to be turned off, but he is also aware that they might be unable to get proper navigational alignment again if they lose the one they currently have.
061:38:36|To start with a powerdown after the burn, they have turned off the DPS control electronics that are not needed anymore, immediately saving about 2 amps.
061:39:51|The Command Module telescope and sextant are usually electrically operated, but they can be hand cranked into position with one of the tools stowed onboard, if necessary.
061:44:22|These switches allow them to choose between the various communications electronics and modes. These will become frequently operated once they begin to experiment with ways to save power while using the radio. Right now they will simply flick the XMTR/RCVR switch to the central OFF position.
061:44:26|Very long comm break
061:53:18|Many interesting points here. in this long read up from Jack Lousma.
061:53:18|At the moment, water is the critical consumable. Water is used for cooling and of course for drinking by the human element of the spacecraft. The Lunar Module has a non-renewable supply, unlike the Command Module which gets its water from the waste products of the fuel cells. The water and electric power consumption are intimately tied together - the more equipment they have running, the more heat is generated, and more water is required to remove that heat. Hence, reducing the power load also reduces the water usage, and trying to minimize both of these is something the crew and Mission Control desire a great deal.
061:53:18|Mission Control is suggesting that the crew takes turns sleeping with one up at all times to answer to the communications or to react to any emergencies. This was behind the thinking during the early Apollo flights as well where a similar arrangement was used to ensure that a crewmember was always ready. The well-meaning plan backfired when it became more than apparent that it was impossible to sleep in the Command Module if anyone was awake and Mission Control kept calling them on the radio. The realization prompted NASA mission planners to decide that it was easier to let everyone sleep at once and have Mission Control monitor systems telemetry in case anything out of place showed up. This arrangement worked very well throughout the rest of the program.
061:54:17|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;We had urine all over the place, stacked in places we never even thought about. The nice thing about it, though, is that we found enough quick disconnects and rigged up lines to get urine into things that normally we were putting other stuff into or taking stuff out of.So it worked out that we could store a lot more urine than we thought we could.&quot;
061:58:36|The inertial platform will maintain its alignment without the computer, hence the LGC can be turned off but the computer would be practically useless without the IMU -hence this procedure would make sense at the moment.
061:59:33|Doppler here refers to the effect of their distance on the speed of the radio signal sent to Apollo and then bounced back to the land-based antennas. The difference can be used to track their exact velocity and location in relation to Earth and the Moon.
062:00:18|In the subject of orbital mechanics, pericynthion refers to the point in a trajectory of a spacecraft launched from Earth where it is closest to the Moon. This is distinct from perilune, the closest point of a orbit around the Moon. Fred picks up on the difference, a measure of his and everyone's desire for precision in language as much as in procedure and measurement.
062:00:18|In this case, a 252-km pericynthion implies that the spacecraft is now on a free return trajectory and is therefore headed for Earth once it coasts over the far side of the Moon, pulled around by lunar gravity.
062:16:58|Very long comm break
062:16:58|The term 'squelch' is familiar to radio hams but may be less so for those not used to the properties of analogue radio. When a radio signal weakens, an amplifier within the receiver increases its gain in order to compensate for the falling levels. As it does so, it also increases the noise inherent in the received signal. There comes a point when the noise overwhelms the signal and this is usually difficult to listen to. The noise is 'squelched' by having it cut out when the amplifier tries too hard to amplify the incoming signal. Usually there is an adjustment to set the level at which squelch occurs.
062:16:58|To preserve power, the LM's high-gain steerable antenna is not going to be used. Instead, their S-band communication will be via either of the two omnidirectional antennae mounted fore and aft of the cabin. The selection of the most appropriate antenna depends on the attitude of the stack and it has been decided that, rather than squelching out the noise when an antenna is no longer favoured, they will simply use the rising noise levels as a cue to switch over to the other antenna.
062:27:45|The TTCA needs the onboard computer for the automatic firing control of the RCS jets. Direct mode bypasses the automatic control and fires the jets manually.
062:30:35|By '06' Jim is referring to Program 06 in the computer, which idles down the LGC.
062:34:31|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;The only shortage we had was what I mentioned on the air. What we really needed was a big, blank pad of paper for our unusual situation.&quot;
062:34:39|The plan at the moment includes trying to align the IMU platform while they are in the shadow of the Moon to improve visibility of the stars, and also to start up the LM's Abort Guidance System, to serve as a backup during the PC+2 burn.
062:38:44|Despite the good efforts of the ground control to set up a new duty cycle for the crew, it will become very difficult to stick to it during the rest of the mission.
062:42:17|Powering down their AC inverter and the FDAI and the associated electronics will save almost 3 amps in power expenditure. It will make it much more difficult to fly the spacecraft, however.
062:42:17|Very long comm break
062:48:56|In the Verb 20 Noun 20 mode, the spacecraft's orientation on each of the three axes of motion - pitch, yaw and roll - can be read from the computer display.

062:56:49|Long comm break
063:07:46|Fred has made a mistake in his readback that Lousma will correct shortly. The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This PAD is for a burn of the LM's main engine two hours after pericynthion (their closest approach to the Moon) in order to return them to a specific place on Earth; in this case the Mid-Pacific Landing site or MPL, and to do so faster than would have been the case with just a unmodified free-return trajectory.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b> 79 hours, 27 minutes, 40.13 seconds.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, +814.4 (+248.2); y, -44.3 (-13.5); z, -222.6 (-67.8). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal).<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub>, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 42):</b> Not applicable. This burn is to place Apollo 13 on a, Earth-bound trajectory, the apogee of which would be over 9999.9 nautical miles, beyond the limit of the computer's display.<br> <b>H<sub>P</sub>, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 42):</b> 20.5 nautical miles (38.0 km). The perigee distance is so low, it will take the spacecraft well into Earth's atmosphere and thereby, the spacecraft will re-enter.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>R</sub>:</b> 845.5 fps (257.7 m/s). This is the total resultant change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 4 minutes, 20 seconds.<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b> Roll, 268&deg;; Pitch, 261&deg;. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform and is therefore set using the FDAI display in its inertial mode. Unlike a CSM PAD, yaw is not stated for the LM. Procedures for a lunar landing allowed the spacecraft to yaw around the thrust axis as required for operational reasons.<br> <b>Change in velocity for the AGS (Noun 86), fps (m/s):</b> x, +815.5 (+248.6); y, -44.3 (-13.5); z, -218.7 (-66.7).<br> <b>GDA angles:</b> Pitch, 5.85&deg;; roll, 6.74&deg;. These are the angles to which the nozzle of the descent engine will be aimed to place its thrust axis through the stack's estimated centre of mass.
063:07:46|Additional notes include a so-called 'ullage' burn to settle the propellants at the bottom of their tanks by burning two of their RCS thrusters for ten seconds. The throttle settings that should be used during the burn are; 5 seconds at 10% thrust to give the computer time to sense if the GDA angles ought to be trimmed. The next 21 seconds will be at a 40% setting with the rest at full throttle. Retro expects that this burn should result in a splashdown time of 142:47 GET.
063:07:46|Three options for the PC+2 maneuver were presented on April the 14th by the RETRO controllers. Each of the three options offered one return scenario for them using the Descent Propulsion System.
063:07:46|A PC+1 maneuver, performed one hour after passing pericynthion instead of 2, would have utilized the entire delta-V capacity of the DPS with a very large burn of 4,728 f/s. This would have put them down in the Mid-Pacific Landing area at 118 hours GET, or just under 40 hours from the burn. In order to generate such thrust, it would be necessary to separate the Service Module, then only dead weight for the spacecraft stack.
063:07:46|The second option, which was also adopted as the one that was performed, was a PC+2 burn of 845 f/s. This too was a burn to target them at the Mid-Pacific Landing area, with a splashdown timed around 142 hours GET. This would have used less than half of the remaining DPS capacity of 1,977 f/s of delta-V with the Service Module attached.
063:07:46|The final option considered was a PC+2 burn using all of the remaining DPS capacity. A delta-V of 1,997 f/s would hurtle them to a landing in the Atlantic Ocean at 133 hours GET.
063:07:46|So why not to jettison the Service Module and utilize the DPS to its maximum capacity to get the crew home as quickly as possible? Wasn't this the most desirable action to take to ensure that the crew would make it back alive within the time they had left on the LM's supplies? Two issues in particular arise. Using the high delta-V options created larger potential for errors in their trajectory. A midcourse correction would also require more thrust, which they might not have if they expended all the DPS fuel. Once the DPS fuel was used up, their course correction capacity would be down more or less to the Lunar Module RCS. This was calculated at 44 ft/s. It was calculated that a course correction from the maximum velocity velocity trajectory could take up to 200 ft/s of delta-V to accomplish. This could require the use of the Ascent Propulsion System, which could only be used after jetisoning the Descent Stage, and with it the majority of their remaining consumables. This would have put them at a considerable risk of running out of water, power and oxygen before landing.
063:07:46|Second, uncertainties existed in regards to the behavior of the Lunar Module-Command Module docked configuration. This had never been flown before and it was not known how it would maneuver. Jettisoning the Service Module would also expose the heat shield at the bottom of the Command Module. Usually this took place minutes before re-entry, but should they have opted to eject the SM before PC+2, they could have been looking at 50 to 60 hours of being exposed to space. The heatshield had thermal limitations in regards to high and low temperatures that could become an issue during the long coast back home. It was also possible that the heat shield was damaged by the internal explosion, and these thermal issues as well as any potential micrometeroid collisions could create additional dangers.
063:07:46|Overall, the safest bet was to press on with the docked condition. It provided a known configuration and protected the heat shield. There were also calculated options to perform further DPS burns after the low-energy PC+2 in order to speed up their return should their consumables situation become worse. The math said that the oxygen, water and power would last long enough to support the slower, and most probably safer return. They simply were not in enough of a hurry to want to face even more extra risks, as detailed above. Saving DPS fuel was essential.
063:17:36|In VERB 16 NOUN 20, the gimbal angles are displayed on the three lines of the DSKY in the order of yaw (outer gimbal), pitch (inner gimbal) and roll (middle gimbal). Jim's remark about the third register means that he is observing the roll angle. It is the middle gimbal that has the unwanted tendency of locking up.
063:19:45|The Pyro sequence breakers connect the two pyrotechnic power system batteries into the sequential system and allow them to fire the explosive devices in the Command-Service Module.
063:21:30|Although the computer DSKY can be used to display the gyro angles, it is not very intuitive to use and causes plentiful confusion for the crew. Usually the 8-ball would show them the deviation and which way to move to correct it, but without the display, it will be much more difficult. This operational mode is viable, but requires them to forget their usual procedure and adopt a new way of thinking while under extreme pressure. The 8-ball is in the spacecraft because the astronauts who have to pilot it wanted it to be there.
063:22:31|This movement takes place on the X axis and has the spacecraft begin to rotate to the right, as if standing on a turn table.
063:23:46|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;We have our Contingency checklist; our method of doing a DPS burn; and how to control using the TTCAs for attitude control, pitch, and roll, and ACA for yaw control. This technique did work and was adequate. In fact, that is the way we flew the vehicle all the time. Our only big problem was when we shut down the FDAI to save power and went to the computer flashing 16 20 , which gave us yaw, pitch, and roll, actually outer, inner, middle gimbal angles. We wanted to keep the middle gimbal angle out of gimbal lock. The technique that is in the contingency checklist is not valid . You can't use the TTCA and fly the computer the way we fly the 8-ball.&quot;
063:23:46|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;That's right.&quot;
063:23:46|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;As a matter of fact, we spent hours trying to do it. I still don't have the technique. You just have to try to figure out by experimenting which way to hit the thruster. It changes depending on where you are, what quadrant you are in, and what theangles are as to which way to throw that translation controller to stop the angle from going toward gimbal lock. We were trying to keep it at a gimbal angle as close to zero as possible. I wasn't too worried about the other two gimbal angles. It was a continual battle to find it.&quot;
063:23:46|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Maybe we ought to do some more research into using that technique. In the future in event of such a contingency, we ought to look at keeping the 8-ball powered up and powering down the DSKY, or something like that. I think our PTC mode was finally the AGS ATT HOLD, which held the vehicle once it was in position.&quot;
063:23:46|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;The problem could be handled the same way that we did it. We taped over each ball top and side and wrote in what the representative TTCA gave in terms of pitchup, pitchdown, roll right, and roll left. This is a nice handy reference. You didn't want to think about the geometry of things if you could just look at this piece of tape and tell you which way to do it.&quot;
063:25:27|What Jack proposes is that instead of the graceful roll of the PTC mode, they will turn the spacecraft around in increments. This was euphemistically called "dynamic PTC" in the post-mission reports.
063:29:08|Verb 77 is the "Set Rate Command/Attitude Hold Mode in DAP" and will utilize the Digital Autopilot to maintain their attitude.
063:32:52|In Attitude Hold, the computer will attempt to maintain their present attitude.
063:33:35|One of the most high-power items on the top row are the LM window heaters, which alone could consume about as much power as their guidance system.
063:34:53|They keep the ATCA control electronics operational, as well as the AOT's heater and parts of the telemetry system.
063:35:30|This configuration keeps their PGNS computer and inertial platform still operational despite the earlier speculation that they should be powered down.
063:38:18|These circuit breakers govern power into the onboard sensors, the electronics that convert the signals into digital data, and then transmits them to Mission Control as telemetry data.
063:39:01|ASA refers to Abort Sensor Assembly, the package of gyroscopes and accelerometers that produce the backup attitude and inertial data for the AGS guidance system. They want to keep the heater powered to maintain it at an operational temperature.
063:39:44|They turn off all the displays but keep the S-band radio operational. The carbon dioxide sensor remains powered as well, being a critical safety system.
063:40:24|SE Audio refers to 'System Engineer's Audio' and this is the LMP's communications panel on his side of the cockpit. In Grumman's parlance, the LMP was referred to as the Systems Engineer and hence the acronym SE pops up occasionally.
063:40:31|This configuration keeps the RCS heaters operational, and powers down unnecessary displays. The EPS configuration maintains load sharing between the batteries in the Descent Stage. They will not tap into the Ascent Stage batteries at this time.
063:42:16|The ASA breaker maintains heating into the Abort Sensor Assembly which contains the backup attitude and acceleration measurement electronics used by the Abort Guidance System, or AGS.
063:43:11|Instead of the graceful, slow roll of the PTC barbeque mode, they will now instead lurch the spacecraft about one quarter of a full circle, let it sit in place and do the next move. This way they will accomplish the same as the more carefully controlled PTC mode, in preventing one-sided cooling or heating of the spacecraft stack structures.
063:49:49|Deadband refers to an option in the DAP on how much the spacecraft is allowed to drift from its desired attitude before the DAP will start firing the RCS jets to attempt to return to that particular attitude. A wider deadband allows for more drift and hence saves fuel.
063:50:54|Jim is referring to the fact that the CM water system is normally operated with the oxygen pressure from the Service Module tanks.
063:53:06|This valve is used to control whether oxygen is drawn into the Command Module from the Service Module or not.
063:53:30|The alarm is not unlike a 1960's equivalent to an USB flash drive warning about being removed too quickly!
063:56:21|Planning and speculating ways to transfer water from the PLSS backpacks into the LM's systems will be a favorite pasttime throughout the rest of the mission for the astronauts and ground crew alike.
064:00:39|The problematic ascent oxygen tank's valves still have a reverse leak, hence its pressure keeps rising. They want to use some of the oxygen again to reduce the pressure.
064:03:43|Although the LM can provide plentiful oxygen and scrub the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, dead air is a genuine problem. Without a constant air flow to move the air, pockets of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichened air may form.
064:07:53|Jack orders Swigert to go back to the Command Module to check the state of several valves in the Environmental Control System. This mostly accounts to making sure that all oxygen valves are closed to ensure none of the O<sub>2</sub> supply in the Command Module is accidentally used. The accumulators are water-glycol coolant tanks.
064:07:53|Oxygen from the life support system enters into a plastic bladder within the tank, hence applying pressure to the contents of the tank and pushing the water out to be used by the crew. Jack reads them a procedure that allowes them to draw water from the drinking water tank by using oxygen pressure from the surge tank.
064:11:57|Very long comm break
|The crew of Apollo 13 are still approaching the Moon with their compromised spacecraft. The Service Module is severely damaged and the Command Module has been powered down to preserve its scarce consumables for re-entry. Only the Lunar Module <i>Aquarius</i> is fully fit but it has the task of housing three men for four days of coasting towards Earth instead of two men for less than two days on the Moon.
|Another task for the LM is to provide the propulsion needed to get back to Earth safely. When the Service Module's oxygen tank exploded, Apollo 13 was on a hybrid free-return trajectory, one that would require significant rocket thrust to get back on a path to Earth. This was achieved at 061:29:42. However, Mission Control is keen to get the crew home faster than will be achieved by their current trajectory, which would return them home at 152 hours GET. Details of a burn to occur two hours after they swing around the Moon have been passed up to them to be burned at 079:27:40. This PC+2 burn is to bring them home at 143 hours GET.
064:37:43|Scientist astronaut Joe Kerwin, MD, has taken over the CapCom position from Jack Lousma. This is the first change of the Capcom during the crisis part of the mission. It's almost six in the morning in Houston, Texas, where Mission Control staff has worked through the night.
064:37:48|Jim makes a rare misidentification here, referring to Kerwin by the name of the previous CapCom, Lousma. His question refers to whether they are required to realign the inertial platform in the shadow of the Moon using programs 51 and 52.
064:38:39|Program 51 involves what is essentially a 'clean slate' state on the IMU. Mission Control thinks that they are close enough to a good alignment as they are that a P52 realignment is the needed option. This will merely check the alignment, instead of trying to create one from scratch.
064:39:56|Mission Control is tracking the spacecraft with radar and using the radio carrier wave sent on the S-Band. They have determined that the closest approach to the surface of the Moon will be at 137 nautical miles, or 253.7 kilometers.
064:47:14|The communications system on the LM provides radio links between the LM and the Earth, between the LM and the Command Module while they are performing separated ops, and also to spacesuited astronauts while on the lunar surface. The VHF radio is only used in short ranges, but the S-Band radio is active throughout the mission during the LM operations. The radio signal from either system goes through the signal processing equipment and the audio centers before reaching the astronauts' comms headsets. The outgoing S-Band signal usually passes through the S-Band power amplifier to produce a more powerful signal required for uninterrupted contact at the high distances involved.
064:47:14|The radio power amplifier is a high power item, using 2.57 amps while operating. Cutting off that power drain would save them a considerable amount of battery power for any future needs.
064:51:01|The steps of the comm procedure to be attempted are as follows:
064:51:01|<b>1.Biomed to Off</b> - The radio link that transmits crew ECG and respiration rates is turned off.
064:51:01|<b>2.Select Low Bit Rate</b> - Telemetry bit rate is switched to low.
064:51:01|<b>3.Choose Downvoice Backup</b> - Selects the backup mode which bypasses the primary electronics on the S-Band signal processor.
064:51:01|<b>4.Power Amplifier to Prime</b> - Selects the primary power amplifier.
064:51:01|<b>5.Open Power Amp circuit breaker on Panel 16</b> - power to the power amplifier is removed from the circuit breaker.
064:51:01|<b>6.Range Function switch to Off</b> - the radio ranging function is turned off.
064:51:35|As soon as they switch their comm mode, the communications loop becomes extremely noisy. Removing the power amplifier causes the signal strength to drop from 18.6 watts to .76 watts.
064:59:56|It sounds like Jim might be sending Jack up to the Command Module to fetch some of their supplies or equipment.
065:04:14|They plan to turn on the S-Band steerable antenna, which can be aimed at the source of the comm signal either manually or automatically, with the antenna following the radio signal on its motorized arm.
065:04:30|These pages are references to the LM Activation Checklist.
065:04:34|Verb 64 would display the antenna's position on the computer screen.
065:05:39|As soon as Joe managed to get the antenna activation procedure read up to the crew, they are pulling the plug on the plan to use the steerable antenna.
065:06:57|This is the first of the dynamic PTC rotations made to try to manage the thermal status of the spacecraft during their coast.
065:19:28|Jack is reminding his compatriots that they have the Ascent stage O<sub>2</sub> tank selected as per the earlier order from Mission Control. They want to use some of it to lower the pressure in the tank which was seen rising earlier.
065:23:09|The crew is on VOX mode and only parts of their conversation are caught on the recording due to clipping and the terrible quality. The snippets captured offer tantalizing suggestions to how the crew would be contemplating their various options at the moment, in semi-privacy.
065:26:47|Their distance is 361,835 kilometers from Earth, and they're moving at 909 m/s.
065:30:30|Jim seems to be concerned about the amount of oxygen they use from the Command Module surge tank whenever they pressurize the water tank.
065:35:48|They reverse the earlier experimental mode by switching to the normal signal processing path.
065:39:52|The selected telemetry bit rate affects the number of times the systems data is refreshed over the digital radio signal as well as whether all sensors are used to send updates to Mission Control. Low Bit Rate means that Mission Control has lost the ability to see everything going on with the Lunar Module Computer - not unlike a remote desktop, being mirrored on their end. Their suggestion now is to enable the various warning lights on the DSKY so that the crew can watch out for the alarms instead.
065:41:30|The DSKY's numeric display and the various warning lights on the panel are powered by different circuitry. Hence their search for the right breakers to make sure they've got power, even if the display itself is unpowered.
065:41:30|Gerry Griffin's Gold Team is taking over Mission Control now from Glynn Lunney's Black Team.
065:52:06|Fine alignment of the LM's guidance platform is achieved using the Alignment Optical Telescope whose external optics are sited at the top of the LM just behind the the antenna for the Rendezvous Radar. In use, the optics are aimed in one of six positions or 'detents' set at 60&deg; intervals. It is possible for the antenna's dish to obstruct the optics at some of these detents if it is not parked out of the way.
065:59:29|Apollo 13's unusual situation caused a conflict between two radio systems because the LM and the Saturn's Instrument Unit (IU) both used the same frequency for radio communication. The expectation was that because the S-IVB/IU being targeted to impact the Moon, and the LM wouldn't be activated until after that point, there would be no conflict between the two systems. Now there was. The solution was to have the IU's radio lock to a ground station and have that ground station gradually move its transmission frequency off to one side, taking the IU with it (because the downlink frequecy is directly derived from the uplink frequency). More details can be found from this splendid essay on Apollo 13 written by one of the Australian comms engineers, Hamish Lindsay, who was based at the <a href="http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/msfn_missions/Apollo_13_mission/index.html" target="new">Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station</a>.
066:10:51|They attempt to improve the perilous comms situation by enabling the power-hungry power amplifier again, out of necessity.
066:34:02|They begin another of their makeshift PTC maneuvers again, rotating once more to maintain thermal equilibrium.
066:36:33|The crew is starting to sound frustrated with the communications situation.
067:02:48|They have moved to the new attitude, with a 90 degrees rotation on the yaw axis, and have stabilized their movement to that attitude.
067:02:48|It is interesting to note here that the PAO is quite free in his discussion of the various return plans, while the crew only gets the eventually decided procedures. It makes sense not to burden them even further at this point with speculation.
067:32:50|This suggested procedure is essentially what was attempted earlier, although with poor results at the time.
067:33:18|They likely are noting the time on their onboard clock, or on one of their wristwatches.
067:37:21|President Nixon would have been busy for the past few days, hosting the West German Chancellor Willy Brandt on an official visit to the US. Chancellor Brandt was present at the Cape for the launch of Apollo 13 - which he witnessed with the US Vice President Spiro Agnew and Wehrner von Brown.
068:03:33|Despite Jim’s gloomy remark here, Apollo 14 with Alan Shepard, Stuart Roosa and Edgar Mitchell launched in January 31st, 1971. - nine months later. Their mission landed on Fra Mauro, originally slated for Apollo 13, and fulfilled all their goals. Their spacecraft was equipped with three modified oxygen tanks and an auxiliary battery in the Service Module, both to better withstand any emergency situations as well as to enable for longer lunar stays during the more elaborate 3-day "J" type missions to the Moon.
068:03:33|Jim’s fatalism was even noted in the Senate, where he had to explain his wording to the politicians during the official Committee hearing on Apollo 13.
068:26:02|Ground tracking has established their closest approach to the surface of the Moon - the pericynthion point - to be around 136 miles or 252 km,, and their calculations for the PC+2 burn are still valid based on that data. This mean that the PAD - the Preadvisory Data read up to them earlier is a GO.
068:38:01|Jim is showing his position as the Captain of the boat by demanding that Mission Control gives him the procedures that he needs. He goes beyond their immediate desire to make sure that the PC+2 burn is performed properly. Jim is also thinking about their eventual Earth landing which will involve turning on the sleeping Command Module again.
068:39:06|Jack's concern is one of paramount important to all of them. The batteries can support them for two hours or so, when fully charged. They know that a part of that capacity has already been spent during the emergency.
068:40:00|The checklist will be the work of many minds supporting the mission, and will be the source of much consternation and debate through the rest of the mission. However even this earlier on, preliminary thinking has already been done, and hence Kerwin is able to give them such information.
068:40:51|Jack speculates on the guidance options for the Earth re-entry, which would involve them powering up the Command Module and possibly getting inertial guidance using the Gyro Display Counter as a backup to the IMU and then use the EMS - the Entry Monitoring System based on that data.
068:42:48|This partially captured remark seems to indicate that the crew onboard has been performing their own calculations on how long their electric power supply would last.
068:45:47|It appears that Mission Control has reason to fear that the lithium hydroxide canisters might swell up from absorbing moisture and then deform, potentially becoming unusable. With the environmental control system offline in the Command Module, the moisture levels are rapidly rising.
068:47:25|Each crewmember had a personalized menu, rotated every 4 days. They could select the most appealing foodstuffs to be taken to space to ensure that they would be most likely to eat all the food despite the difficulties in preparation and the altered taste and texture caused by the various preservation methods.
068:48:56|They are presumably talking about the LM batteries, with the figures involved. The CM batteries have a total capacity of about 120 amp hours.
068:51:43|Fred’s been suffering from headaches earlier in the mission, leading to him vomiting a couple times during the translunar coast, while probably suffering from space sickness. He’s going to be feeling even sicker later on once he develops a urinary tract infection.
068:51:43|They a have medical kit in the Command Module and a smaller one in the LM. Aspirin is one of the over the counter medications carried, besides eye drops, decongestants, and stronger stuff like amphetamines and Demerol.
069:06:43|Jack is most likely thinking about the possibility of the water in the Command Module running out and them having to start consuming water from LM tanks which they need for the cooling as much as for their own sustenance.
069:13:46|The plan to improve the comm situation is to switch the power amplifier back on and go to the normal VOICE option.
069:18:26|Fred is hoping to hear the time of their startup of the LM during the emergency. Joe Kerwin misunderstands this, however.
069:20:05|Joe is talking about their plans for performing the PC+2 burn, thinking that it's what the crew wants to hear.
069:24:02|The crew appears to be wondering about the PLSS once again. Throughout the mission, they keep coming up with schemes on either using the water contained in the PLSS to transfer it into the LM Ascent Stage, or use the PLSS to transfer water from the CM into the LM.
069:25:00|Albeit only an annoyance here, such misunderstandings could put their life in peril. The poor communications link does not help the issue at all.
069:30:29|Both of the procedures speculated on by Joe Kerwin will eventually be performed, first to check the condition of the Command Module Main Bus B and then to recharge the re-entry batteries.
070:53:22|This very long readout from Mission Control tells a lot about the upcoming plan to make sure their navigation systems are working properly. The ground controllers have calculated an attitude for the spacecraft to take, in which at a given moment, the Sun should be visible through the AOT telescope in the Lunar Module. By having the computer fly the spacecraft into this attitude, using the onboard navigational reference to do so, the crew can determine whether the inertial platform is still accurate enough to perform the crucial burn to take them home. If they can’t see the Sun at the moment the computer thinks they should be able to do so, a P52 inertial platform realignment could be performed later while they move into the shadow of the Moon.
070:53:22|Another problem to solve is the radar antenna, which is locked into place and would be in the way of the telescopic sightings. They have to use the computer to drive the antenna to another position.
070:57:32|The purpose of the PC+2 burn at 79 hours is to boost their speed coming away from the Moon and to target them to their Pacific landing zone around 142 hours GET. This maneuver ought to cut out 10 hours from their return time and give them a much more comfortable marginal when it comes to their consumables.
071:05:53|This noisy but workable state of the radio will remain the norm for the rest of the mission. They will turn up the high power equipment only when involved in crucial conversations, such as passing on procedures, checklists or PADs.
071:06:37|Joe Kerwin is joking gently along with Fred here, lightening the mood during a very tense time. Interestingly, only three years later, Kerwin would be part of the crew of the very first American space station, Skylab. Their one-month space mission broke the American space endurance record previously held by none other than Jim Lovell.
071:09:43|The waste tank contains water produced by the fuel cells, not human wastes.
071:29:42|Silence falls for almost an hour again. They pass onto the fourth day of the mission, with 72 hours elapsed time in space. It is 17 hours since the accident. It is April 14th in Houston, half past 1 in the afternoon.
|Just over 16 hours ago, at 055:54:53 GET, Apollo 13's Service Module was severely damaged when a fire within an oxygen tank caused it to catastropically burst. The crew don't know the reason for their crippled craft but they are well aware of its implications and have moved into <i>Aquarius</i>, their Lunar Module and now their lifeboat. Ten hours ago, they burned the LM's descent engine for 31 seconds to return the spacecraft to a trajectory that would swing them around the Moon and bring them back to Earth. Specifically, it would land them in the Indian Ocean at about 152 hours Ground Elapsed Time. MCC are now planning another burn that will occur two hours after they pass the Moon. This is intended to shorten their drop to Earth and have them land in the Pacific Ocean at about 142 hours GET, at a landing site near to where the US Navy's recovery fleet were planning to recover them anyway.
|An additional reason for this timing concerns a graphite cask on the side of the LM. It carries and protects a fuel element containing plutonium which had been intended to power experiments on the lunar surface. NASA would like to safely dispose of this material and intend to do so by having the LM re-enter Earth's atmosphere in such a way as to allow the cask to sink to the bottom of the Tonga Trench which, at over 10 kilometres, is one of the deepest parts of the world's oceans. With the graphite cask designed to survive reentry, this would also alleviate the fears of the Atomic Energy Commission.
072:08:15|The Air to Ground loop tape has captured some conversation between the MSFN land station operators. Specific channels allowed the stations to talk to one another to keep everything running smoothly.
072:27:51|Charlie Duke is the Backup LMP for the mission and hence the perfect person to relay information about Lunar Module procedures to his compatriot Fred Haise. They would have trained closely together throughout the preparation for Apollo 13.
072:27:51|They crank up the primary communications gear and the ranging system for the duration of the navigation talk with Duke.
072:28:54|What they begin here is not a typical P52 realignment, but instead they are using the software's capacity to aim their optics at any point, as long as they have the correct time and the coordinates available. This was the procedure they were using earlier during the mission to attempt to spot Comet Bennett. The P52 was selected for the Sun check due to it being more fuel efficient than the other automatic maneuver modes.
072:29:32|Fred Haise is not talking about the comm signal breaking, but instead comments on Charlie Duke’s fateful German measles that put the whole Apollo program into temporary turmoil and caused Fred’s prime crew crewmate Ken Mattingly to be replaced by the backup Jack Swigert, from Duke’s crew.
072:29:36|Charlie confirms the situation.
072:29:36|Apollo 13 backup Lunar Module Pilot Charlie Duke flew in the that role onboard Apollo 16, along with Apollo 13 backup Commander John Young and Ken Mattingly, finally getting his chance on the role of Command Module Pilot. 35-year-old Duke was a test pilot before being chosen for astronaut training in 1966 in Astronaut Group 5.
072:31:16|The LM Guidance and Navigation (or G&N) Dictionary serves as an onboard reference for the crew on the various procedures for using the Lunar Guidance Computer (LGC) and the Abort Guidance System (AGS).
072:31:24|The IMU Align procedure in the checklist is a kind of a spaceman choose your own adventure - different options and techniques call for different procedures, and hence the checklist may command you to jump from Step 1 to Step 2 or 6, for example.
072:31:28|To start the IMU realign, the first move is to make sure that the AOT telescope's internal lighting is enabled by putting in the circuit breaker. Afterwards, the LGC is selected to run the associated program in its memory. To do this, they key in VERB 37, which is the CHANGE PROGRAM command, hit ENTER, and then type in 52, for the IMU Align program.
072:31:28|P52, Step 1 starts with entering VERB 04 NOUN 06 (DISPLAY DECIMAL - OPTION CODE), which allows them to choose from the options presented to them as choices such as listed on the procedure here. They select option 3, REFSMMAT and hit PRO to move to Step 6. Naturally all they would see on their computer is numbers on the green display, hence the paper checklist would be crucial on interpreting the computer output, and selecting their preferred input.
072:31:28|P52, Step 6 begins with entering VERB 50 NOUN 25 (PLEASE PERFORM - CHECKLIST), and here they are to choose the manner of acquiring the stars they desire for the sightings to align the inertial platform. They choose the MANUAL ACQUISITION mode by hitting ENTER at this point. Another option would be the allow the computer to choose suitable stars with the PICAPAR routine, but this is not what they need right now, since they are looking for a specific target and do not require the shortcut that is PICAPAR. It selects two stars close to each other within the telescope's field of view, so as to save RCS fuel by not needing to turn the spacecraft around to look for suitable navigational stars.
072:31:28|P52, Step 7 moves on by entering VERB 01 NOUN 70. (DISPLAY OCTAL COMPONENT - AOT STAR CODE/DETENT) This is where the crew specifies what viewing device and what sighting star they wish to use for the alignment. The choice is coded onto Register 1 of the LGC with the 00CDE code, where the letters are codes for the various numeric values the string can have. The letters on the checklist are there to help with interpreting the printed checklist. Duke’s command of entering ‘200’ here means that they pick the number 2 option, which is the F for FORWARD detent on the AOT, and ‘00’ is for the star code of the star to be sighted, which here signifies planet. Starcode 00 is used as placeholder, of sorts, and requires them to input the vector values of the location where this object might be found. It could also be a star not in the in-built catalogue, too.
072:31:28|It is of interest to note that should the AOT not be available, the P52 alignment could also be done by using the COAS monocular on the forward window or the overhead docking window.
072:32:24|Step 7 continues with another PRO from the operator that is followed by entering the command VERB 06 NOUN 88 - (DISPLAY DECIMAL IN R1,R2,R3- CELESTIAL BODY VECTOR X,Y,Z) as per their earlier choice of “option 00” on the star code selection, and this allows them to enter the expected vector values for the sighting at the time of the AOT check. This way the computer will know where they should be looking at at the time of the Sun check - although it is up to the crew identify and confirm it by looking into the telescope! This time, their target being the Sun, there ought to be no difficulty in interpreting the results.
072:32:48|By having the unit vectors halved, this enables them to store them in the computer with a higher number of significant numbers, and hence more accurate.
072:33:48|At Step 8 it is time to maneuver the ship to an attitude as specified by the FDAI. Entering the command VERB 50 NOUN 18 (PLEASE PERFORM - DESIRED MANEUVER TO FDAI RPY ANGLES) allows them to program their desired attitude into the computer. They choose to use the AUTO mode on the PGNS computer instead of going manual so that the LGC will then try to fly them into this attitude. It is important to note here that VERB 50 NOUN 18 requires them to input roll, pitch and yaw angles to be read from the 8-ball, which means that these values are not identical to the alignment on these axes for the inertial measuring platform.
072:34:52|Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin performed a Sun check to confirm their LM IMU alignment as well, before heading for the surface.
072:34:52|VERB 62 commands the computer to DISPLAY TOTAL ATTITUDE ERROR. In this context error refers to the difference between their desired attitude and their present attitude. The FDAI 8-ball has mechanical needles that the computer can drive to give a visual and intuitive reference for the pilot on how to make their attitude as close as possible to that they wish to move to or maintain. During the automatic maneuver, they would see these error needdles move towards the zero position.
072:38:38|The DAP, or Digital AutoPilot, is a routine in the computer that runs in the background to automatically keep control of the spacecraft's attitude. Various parameters concerning its operation can be set by altering the contents of a register. For example, whether its controlling just the CSM or whether there is another vehicle docked to it, which thrusters to use, what size of deadband and how fast it should correct any error. '31120' reads as docked configuration (CSM and LM), 2 jets from system B, normal scaling at 2 degrees per second, 5-degree deadband, and .2 decrees per second rates allowed.
072:38:41|If the Sun is found at the correct time, they can simply stop the P52 without doing any changes to their platform. If the Sun check does not pass, they plan to do a P52 realignment using sightings of the Sun and the Earth instead of stars. For this they require another set of three-dimensional coordinates for each spatial body.
072:41:24|Charlie is referring to the apparently size of the Earth in the field of view of the AOT, as well as how much of its surface is lit by the sun at the time. They would have the computerized system in Mission Control to produce this kind of information.
072:42:39|On Step 8 they use VERB 50 NOUN 18 PLEASE PERFORM -DESIRED MANEUVER TO FDAI RPY ANGLES) to enter the FDAI angles. Each angle occupies one register (or one line) on their computer display. The input RPY or Roll/Pitch/Yaw angles will take the spacecraft to the desired position for the Sun check, manually or automatically using computer control.
072:43:16|Charlie Duke caused a brief confusion by giving the angles in the wrong format to support them being input into the computer in the form required by the procedure.
072:43:33|R1,R2 and R3 refers to each register, or display lines on the computer's three lines of numeric display.
072:43:48|The rendezvous radar dish is currently blocking the AOT and they need to drive it to a new position using the computer.
072:45:47|VERB 49 maneuvers utilize movement in three axes, while the P52 is a two-axis maneuver.
072:47:26|So far this procedure gets up INVERTER 2 to provide alternating current for the power-hungry radar, and enables primary computer control of the radar antenna.
072:47:29|Next step is to use VERB 41 NOUN 72 to input the desired shaft and trunnion angles to position the radar antenna. The antenna has two degrees of motion, hence they input values for both of them.
072:47:29|Hence they would input the following:
072:47:29|<b>+00000</b> - the angle of the shaft (up and down motion) remains zero
072:47:29|<b>+28300</b> - the angle of the trunnion (left and right motion) is set to 283 degrees, which moves it to the left and outside the field of view of the AOT during the upcoming Sun check.
072:47:29|The rendezvous radar. It has two degrees of motion, along the shaft (for pitch, or up and down) and trunnion (for yaw, for left and right).
072:47:29|Inputting Verb 16 Noun 72 displays the current angle of the rendezvous radar on the computer's R1 and R2 registers ie. the first and second lines on the DSKY.
072:48:53|Verb 44 is the command to terminate the rendezvous radar operation via the computer and release it for other functions. The last step is to take out the Inverter 2 circuit breaker to turn off the AC power.
072:50:01|The AOT has an internal lamp that illuminates the reticle inside. They have to enable the lamp's power supply and crank up the AC inverter to provide the lamp with AC power.
072:53:11|The FDAIs have been powered off to save battery power during the coast to the burn, and need to be brought back up for their maneuvers.
072:54:33|Gemini and Apollo astronaut David Scott is supporting the mission by running simulations on ways to control the spacecraft in its unusual state.
072:54:33|Dave Scott would later serve as a technical advisor on the set of the Ron Howard Apollo 13 film.
072:57:30|The rings that support the guidance platform act as gimbals which let the spacecraft rotate as the platform maintains a constant orientation with respect to the stars. This is achieved because the hinges between each gimbal afford the arrangement three degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, thanks to the (deliberate) choice of using only three gimbals, there is an orientation which can be adopted whereby the middle gimbal moves in such a way that the axes for the outer and inner gimbals line up.
072:57:30|All the axes are now in the same plane and so the arrangement has essentially lost one of its degrees of freedom. It is no longer capable of isolating the rotation of the spacecraft from the platform. This condition is termed gimbal lock. If it is inadvertently adopted, it will require a realignment of the platform, something they don't want the crew to have to do. Hence, both the crew and Mission Control are keeping a careful eye on the middle gimbal. Should its angle exceed 70 degrees, the computer will light the GIMBAL LOCK warning light. 85 degrees is the absolute limit, after which a gimbal lock condition does exist and their attitude reference is lost.
072:57:30|The middle gimbal monitors the roll axis, (also known as R, or the Z axis). It is a conscious design choice to implement the inherent limit of the three-gimbal design to the middle gimbal, since rotations on the roll axis are the least required, and easiest to avoid in mission planning.
073:01:04|They need DC and AC power to the FDAI as well as the GASTA electronics that interface between the IMU and the 8-ball.
073:03:34|Return to the low power comm configuration has also returned the poor audio quality.
073:09:11|Fred is of course referring to the Apollo 11 astronauts. Besides Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan of Apollo 10 and Apollo 12's Pete Conrad and Alan Bean, these six astronauts are the ones with experience operating the AOT in the actual near-lunar environment.
073:09:11|Astronaut Vance Brand is back for his first CapCom duty shift since the beginning of the emergency.
073:16:25|Jim thinks that the radar antenna could still cause trouble when they are trying to spot the Sun and the Earth for their P52 realignment.
073:18:21|It sounds like Jim has spotted some debris moving along with them.
073:27:30|While they wait the upcoming Sun check, the astronauts go back to their common topic of using the PLSS backpacks for extra water supplies or for transferring water supplies.
073:36:29|Mission Control can't read their computer display or the gyroscopic information indicating their attitude due to the telemetry being on the Low Bit Rate mode.
073:39:27|Mission Control attempted to use a larger antenna to receive the weak signal from the spacecraft, with no success. They have to switch back to low bit rate to receive at least some telemetry.
073:41:25|Jim does not sound entirely convinced about the plan to use sightings of the Earth and the Sun to align the IMU, if it should come to that. As the Earth and the Sun are not only much larger targets to get a fix on, they are also extremely close in comparison to the stars they usually use for navigational purposes, hence there is further potential for errors.
073:47:10|Jim later remembered the Sun check in an official NASA history of the mission. Here he painted it in a rather more dramatic light than is immediately evident from the transcription.
073:47:10|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">Apollo Expeditions to the Moon (NASA SP-350, 1975):</span></b> &quot;We had many crises on Apollo 13, but the biggest heart-stopper has hardly been noticed, partly because the transcription released to the press was garbled, and partly because there wasn't much point in talking about a crisis that had been averted earlier.&quot;
073:47:10|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">Apollo Expeditions to the Moon (NASA SP-350, 1975):</span></b> &quot;We had transferred the CM platform alignment to the LM, but we had to make sure that this alignment was accurate before we made the long P.C.+2 burn.&quot;
073:47:10|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">Apollo Expeditions to the Moon (NASA SP-350, 1975):</span></b> &quot;So what to do? A genius in Mission Control came up with the idea of using the Sun to check accuracy of our alignment. No amount of debris could blot out that star! Its large diameter could result in considerable error, but nobody had a better plan.&quot;
073:47:10|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">Apollo Expeditions to the Moon (NASA SP-350, 1975):</span></b> &quot;When I looked through the AOT, the Sun just had to be there. It really had to be. And it was. At 73:46 hours, the air-to-ground transcript sounds like a song from "My Fair Lady". [...] If we raised our voices, I submit it was justified.&quot;
073:47:10|Jim is most likely referring to the song "The Rain in Spain" from the popular 1956 musical and its 1964 film adaptation.
073:47:10|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">Apollo Expeditions to the Moon (NASA SP-350, 1975):</span></b> &quot;I'm told the cheer of the year went up in Mission Control. Flight Director Gerald Griffin, a man not easily shaken, recalls: "Some years later I went back to the log and looked up that mission. My writing was almost illegible I was so damned nervous. And I remember the exhilaration running through me: My God, that's kinda the last hurdle—if we can do that, I know we can make it. It was funny, because only the people involved knew how important it was to have that platform properly aligned." Yet Gerry Griffin barely mentioned the alignment in his change-of-shift briefing. "That check turned out real well" is all he said an hour after his penmanship failed him. Neither did we, as crew members, refer to it as a crisis in our press conference nor in later articles.&quot;
073:53:50|There appears to be some confusion as to what kind of angles Vance is offering to the crew.
073:56:33|Verb 49 activates the computer routine that can be used to input a desired attitude into the computer, and then used as a reference for flying into that attitude.
074:04:51|A momentary confusion has ensued from Vance's attempt to read the crew the angles for their preferred attitude. It turns out that the reason was due to the different way the Command Module and the Lunar Module handles the input of the angles into the guidance computer. While the Command Module Computer takes them in the order of RPY - Roll-Pitch-Yaw, the Lunar Module uses YPR - Yaw-Pitch-Roll.
074:04:51|Another reason for this questioning is that the angles given are the ICDU - Inertial Coupling Data Unit angles, which refer to the angles of the IMU gimbals, not the FDAI 8-ball indicator, which would give its own readings.
074:05:24|VERB 50 NOUN 18 is the AUTO maneuver they want to take to the new attitude.
074:07:48|The middle gimbal senses their motion and acceleration on the roll axis, and is the one prone for the infamous gimbal lock.
074:08:51|The gimbal lock is closer than ever, resulting in a quick warning from John Young, who is monitoring in Mission Control again.
074:10:30|Verb 49's automatic maneuver is trying to fly them right into gimbal lock. They have to try to do it under crew control.
074:10:54|Mission Control photo from during the emergency shows many key players in returning the crew home. Seated are Deke Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations, Jack Lousma serving as the CapCom and backup Commander John Young, smoking a pipe. Grounded Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly and Capcom astronaut Vance Brand are standing up.
074:17:05|A further confusion has ensued among the crew about whether the angles were for the IMU or the FDAI.
074:19:47|They need improved signal strength to be able to transmit the high bit rate telemetry Mission Control requires to monitor the gimbal angles.
074:31:22|Vance’s cryptic-sounding instructions are used to change the deadband maintained by the DAP. To do so, they use the Verb 21 Noun 01 command to change information in the computer's 2 kilobytes of erasable memory. They first input the known memory location - or address - of the computer instruction they want to access, and then input a new value for the program to take so that the DAP will perfom as desired.
074:31:22|This type of computer operation is known as Assembler coding.
074:35:07|They go back to the low power comms configuration and also power off the FDAI to save some power.
074:54:23|The original transcript transcribes Fred's question as "contingency QR DPS?" but upon close listening of the tape it is clearly heard that he says "two hour" instead.
074:54:38|To prepare for the PC+2 burn, they are using the LM Contingency Activation Handbook's pre-written procedures and altering them as required.
074:55:18|This simply activates the EPS displays, which have been powered down to save up their batteries.
074:56:08|The only real procedures here are changing the desired inverter configuration.
074:57:04|Normally this procedure assumes a fully functioning Command Module, including its Mission timer and onboard clock. While usually the time would be input by having someone in the CM communicate it to the LM by shouting it down the hatch, they will now use the LM computer to display the time and then input it into the mission timer.
074:57:11|Page 3 offers procedures for activating the Caution and Warning system for the burn. Their warning lights will light up if any trouble comes up with the engine pressures or the electric power delivered to the CES - the engine control electronics.
074:59:10|This circuit breaker configuration only leaves the RCS thrusters and their control systems powered.
075:00:39|This configuration leaves suit fan 1, the glycol pump transfer, the IMU and Inverter 1 powered.
075:04:52|Charlie moves on to talk about the configuration desired for the LMP’s side of the circuit breaker panels. Again only the RCS thrusters remain powered, with the crew able to choose whether they want to use the internal lighting or not.
075:05:34|No changes are made on the pages concerning the computer, the communications or the RCS systems, since these are up and running since they powered up the Lunar Module.
075:06:21|The AGS user interface may seem baffling at first, but is down to a simple operational logic. The ADDRESS INDICATOR is used to display the octal numeric address of the location in the computer memory either for inputting a new value into it or to reading out its current contents on the DEDA display.
075:06:21|All data input follows a simple procedure:
075:06:21|Press <b>CLR</b> (Clear) button to empty the display
075:06:21|Input the three-digit memory address
075:06:21|Press <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> sign
075:06:21|Input five-digit data in either decimal or octal numbers
075:06:21|Press <b>ENTR</b> (Enter)
075:06:21|To access data in the AGS computer memory, the procedure consists of pressing <b>CLR</b> to empty the display, then enter the three-digit address of the data to be viewed, followed by pressing the </b>READOUT</b> button to display the stored value on the DEDA screen.
075:06:21|The <b>HOLD</b> button can be used to keep the current readout on the screen where it will refresh twice a second, until <b>CLR</b> is pressed again to reset the DEDA and to allow the crewman to begin a new DEDA input or readout.
075:07:13|An abbreviated AGS startup follows on page 12. It begins by selecting the appropriate switches to power up the Abort Guidance System electronics. Once the AGS computer is hence turned on steps 2,3 and 4 perform a brief procedure to test it and then to input a few basic values the AGS needs to operate successfully.
075:07:13|All of the following commands are given with the normal procedure:
075:07:13|<b>CLR/DEDA ADDRESS/PLUS OR MINUS/FIVE-DIGIT CODE/ENTER</b>
075:07:13|<b>CLR 000 +888888 ENTER</b> - lights up all the digits on the DEDA electroluminescent display and ensures that they are working properly
075:07:13|<b>CLR 123 -45679 ENTER</b> - tests the DEDA keyboard by pressing all the numeric keys on it
075:07:13|<b>CLR 412 +00000 ENTER</b> - runs the AGS SELF TEST
075:07:13|A successful test is indicated by the DEDA displaying <b>412 +100000</b>
075:07:13|The other possible displays indicate failures of the AGS electronics. Steps 5,6,7 conclude an initial setup of the AGS.
075:07:13|<b>574</b> - DESCENT STAGE FLAG (indicates whether the LM has staged or not)
075:07:13|<b>+00000 ENTER</b> is input
075:07:13|<b>604</b> LUNAR SURFACE FLAG (tells the AGS whether the LM is landed on the Moon)
075:07:13|<b>+00000 ENTER</b> is input
075:07:13|<b>612</b> STAGING SEQUENCE COUNTER (status check)
075:07:13|<b>+00000 ENTER</b> is input
075:07:13|The IMU align on page 13 is not done, since they have a properly aligned platform already.
075:07:13|For the AGS Align procedure, they input <b>400 +50000</b> into the DEDA. This aligns the AGS inertial reference frame with the XYZ body axes of the Lunar Module.
075:07:13|They change the gimbal/throttle setup only in that automatic computer control mode is used instead of manual firing.
075:08:15|The Verb 48 loads DAP data into the LGC. Noun 46 allows them to input the five-digit DAP configuration code into the register. In this case, it is 31021 instead of the 32021 suggested by the checklist. The difference is that they want to use 2 RCS jets instead of 4 and hence the second digit is changed to correspond to the DAP setup for this configuration.
075:08:15|Verb 47 is used to load the known weight of the CSM and the LM. While the LM weight is printed on the checklist, it tells the astronaut to ask the CSM weight from either the docked spacecraft or Mission Control. The LM would have been essentially inert until this point, hence its weight is known.
075:08:15|They insert a VERB 34 ENTER after the weight input, which is the code to terminate the operation. They do not wish to proceed with the Noun 48 on the checklist, which would be used to change the orientation of the Descent Engine Gimbals that control the position of the engine nozzle.
075:09:45|Instead of the procedure that would be used to test fire newly started RCS jets, they use this part of the checklist to make sure that the attitude control options and the manual controllers are properly configured.
075:10:23|Jim is probably referring to the COAS monocular.
075:11:01|The long procedure on the top of the page is the Program 30 or Crew-defined Maneuver, which allows them to input the engine burn data they have written down on the PC+2 PAD into the LGC so that the computer can calculate the burn commands.
075:11:01|The CSM Maneuver is removed, since they will use the LM to maneuver into the burn attitude, having no operational CSM.
075:11:27|Again Fred shows that he is following Charlie Duke's instructions carefully, and that he is intimately knowledgeable of all the procedures and systems involved with the LM.
075:11:35|The checklist makes preparations for using the Ascent Propulsion System in case the DPS fails or is not sufficient to put them on a return trajectory. This is not the plan for the moment and hence this procedure is axed.
075:12:44|The top of the page 17 of the checklist contains instructions on how to set up the Abort Guidance System for the upcoming engine burn. These will be used to monitor the PC+2 burn as well as provide backup in case of primary system failure. The first four instructions are input with the <b>CLR/DEDA ADDRESS/PLUS OR MINUS/FIVE-DIGIT CODE/ENTER</b> procedure.
075:12:44|<b>400 +00000</b> - sets up AGS Attitude Hold
075:12:44|<b>404 +00000</b> - delta-<sub>v</sub> on the X axis
075:12:44|<b>405 +00000</b> - delta-<sub>v</sub> on the Y axis
075:12:44|<b>406 +00000</b> - delta-<sub>v</sub> on the Z axis
075:12:44|These four AGS commands order the Abort Guidance System to monitor the LM’s acceleration on all three axes of motion during the engine burn.
075:12:44|The last thing input is the address <b>470</b> which is the AGS address for <b>MONITOR delta-<sub>v</sub> X</b>. By pressing <b>READOUT</b> they instruct the AGS to display the change in the spacecraft acceleration on the DEDA along the X-axis. This way the AGS produces another way for them to display the amount of velocity change generated by the firing of the DPS engine during the PC+2 burn.
075:13:26|Fred is curious about what they should do if the PC+2 burn fails. Duke's advice is to shut down the engine in case of trouble and they'll handle any required changes to their trajectory later on.
075:14:07|MASTER ARM is required to be ON only during the first DPS engine burn so that the supercritical helium can be released via pyrotechnic valve. Since they have already burnt the engine once, it is not required here at this time for PC+2.
075:14:33|Here comes a rare disagreement between Fred's view of the procedure to take, and ground control.
075:15:03|Fred comes to a quick realization of the logic behind Mission Control's thinking, and has no qualms about it.
075:15:58|In the run-up to the engine start, they will enable ENGINE ARM and then perform the ullage by firing the RCS thrusters to settle the fuel in the Descent Engine tanks.
075:15:58|At -05 seconds they input the command VERB 99 NOUN 40 (ENABLE ENGINE IGNITION-TIME FROM IGNITION) and hit PRO to let the computer allow the engine firing under automatic control.
075:15:58|Charlie offers not one but two different ways to start the DPS should the automatic computer start not happen.
075:15:58|Panel 5 has the protected manual engine start button, to be used in case the automatic system won't work.
075:15:58|Duke suggests that in case the manual engine start fails, they can use the DES ENG CMD OVRD switch to fire the engine.
075:16:48|They add the command VERB 76 (SET MINIMUM IMPULSE MODE IN DAP) here to go to such mode in the Digital Autopilot after their engine burn.
075:17:16|Charlie describes here, should the computer fail to perform the engine stop and start, how to do it manually using the buttons and the manual throttle.
075:19:31|Charlie Duke wants to give Fred advice on how to modify the onboard DPS burn cue card to accommodate the changes made to the procedures for the PC+2 burn. The card is meant to be used for normal Powered Descent operations. These kind of cue cards could be Velcro'd to various parts of the LM cabin to provide a quick reference to crucial procedures and information at times of high activity.
075:19:31|This in-training photo shows several sticky cue cards attached to the LM console. There're further cards on the DSKY platform as well as what appears to be a checklist clipped onto the yellow handles around the AOT.
075:22:39|Jim suggests that the changes to the card are perhaps superfluous, considering that he does not plan to use the card.
075:23:34|The G&N Dictionary contains a list of the navigational sighting stars. Jim has identified 33 (Antares) and 37 (Nunki)
075:24:44|Mission Control thinks that they do not need to do any further refinements to the inertial platform. They want to save up RCS fuel by not making more maneuvers at the moment. Jim was enthusiastic about performing a proper P52 inertial platform alignment by star sightings.
075:31:21|The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This PAD is for a burn of the LM's main engine two hours after pericynthion (their closest approach to the Moon) in order to return them to a specific place on Earth; in this case the Mid-Pacific Landing site or MPL, and to do so faster than would have been the case with just a unmodified free-return trajectory.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b> 79 hours, 27 minutes, 40.07 seconds.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, +819.2 (+ 249,7 m/s); y, -20.0 (- 6.0 m/s); z, -218.9 (-66,7 m/s). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal).<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub>, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 42):</b> Not applicable. This burn is to place Apollo 13 on a Earth-bound trajectory, the apogee of which would be over 9999.9 nautical miles, beyond the limit of the computer's display.<br> <b>H<sub>P</sub>, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 42):</b> 20.9 nautical miles (38.7 km). The perigee distance is so low, it will take the spacecraft well into Earth's atmosphere and thereby, the spacecraft will re-enter.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>R</sub>:</b> 848.2 fps (258.53 m/s). This is the total resultant change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 4 minutes, 20 seconds.<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b> Roll, 274&deg;; Pitch, 82&deg;. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform and is therefore set using the FDAI display in its inertial mode. Unlike a CSM PAD, yaw is not stated for the LM. Procedures for a lunar landing allowed the spacecraft to yaw around the thrust axis as required for operational reasons.<br> <b>Change in velocity for the AGS (Noun 86), fps (m/s):</b> x, +820.3 (+); y, -20.0 (-); z, -215.0 (-).<br> <b>GDA angles:</b> Not applicable. These would normally be the angles to which the nozzle of the descent engine would be aimed to place its thrust axis through the stack's estimated centre of mass.
075:31:21|The throttle settings that should be used during the burn are; 5 seconds at 10% thrust to give the computer time to sense if the GDA angles ought to be trimmed. The next 21 seconds will be at a 40% setting with the rest at full throttle.
075:35:07|Conventionally, a return-to-Earth PAD would be for the CSM and it would include information pertaining to re-entry. However, the PAD given above was for the LM and those PADs don't include re-entry information so Brand is reading up that part of a CSM PAD that is relevant in this case. Some of the data is given with respect to Entry Interface, an arbitary moment on their trajectory when they are 400,000 feet [121.92 km] above Earth.<br> <b>Expected splashdown point (Noun 61):</b> 21.47&deg; south, 165.0&deg; west; in the mid-Pacific.<br> <b>Range to go:</b> 1,166.0 nautical miles (2,159.4 km). To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel after Entry Interface. This would be decremented later based on the readings from the EMS' own accelerometer measuring the change in their velocity and hence ability to fly downrange.<br> <b>Expected velocity at Entry Interface:</b> 36,291 fps (11,062 m/s).<br> <b>Time of Entry Interface:</b> 142 hours, 39 minutes and 20 seconds GET. This is the predicted time at which the spacecraft would reach the entry interface altitude.
075:35:50|They are cranking up the normal communications mode and select the power amplifier to ensure a good transfer of the computer update via the Up Data Link.
075:43:44|They're reversing the comms configuration back to the low power mode.
075:46:26|PCM refers to Pulse Code Modulation. It is the contempoary term for digitally coded information. The telemetry system gathers the analogue electric signals from the onboard monitoring equipment, converts it into the PCM data stream, and then transmits it to Mission Control.
075:56:16|In zero gravity, any loose particles float endlessly around, propelled by the flow of air within the cabin. The suction created by the ECS air flow can pull these particles into the system and damage it. They could also be accidentally inhaled by the crew. The crew is using simple screens in front of the hose openings to catch the dirt.
075:57:19|Vance Brand is referring to center of gravity. It is essential to know the center of gravity for the spacecraft, considering all of its maneuverability - and the predictability of it thereof - is dependent on it. A moment earlier Fred asked if the Mission Control personnel was keeping book on everything that was removed from Command Module into the Lunar Module. The crew thinks that once they are about to return to Earth, they must know exactly what equipment has been taken back to the CM and what is left in the LM, so as to know the exact weight and mass distribution of the Command Module. This has ramifications for their orientation during re-entry. Right now Vance suggests that the neglible weight of the hose caps will not have an effect.
076:01:31|It sounds like the crew is doing some cleaning up while they are waiting for their next maneuver.
076:05:26|It sounds like Jim wants to take the PLSS backpacks into the Command Module once they begin re-entry.
076:06:17|They are debating whether to wear their spacesuits for the Earth landing. No crew has landed in suits since Apollo 7.
076:07:14|Jim might be planning ways on how to hook up their spacesuits to the PLSS while in the Command Module.
076:08:12|This partially captured remark is tantalizing in its incompleteness.
076:11:12|Jim has located the navigational stars again.
076:16:16|They want to know when they should start powering up the LM's systems for the PC+2 burn.
076:17:38|The distance of Apollo 13 from the Moon is now less than the distance between New York and London (3,008 nautical miles)
076:22:22|Mission Control appears to have been using the computerized image processor to create simulations on what the expected view is through the LM's optical instruments and the windows, hence they are able to tell the crew what they should see to confirm their attitude.
076:23:17|They can view the navigational stars to ensure that they are maintaining proper attitude during the engine burn.
076:24:39|Through the eyepiece of the AOT, a crewman sees a graticule or reticle that shows a radial line and a spiral.
076:24:39|The pattern can be rotated so that first, the radial line coincides with a star, yielding a 'shaft' angle, then it it rotated again to make the spiral coincide with the star which yields the 'reticle' angle. The computer can combine these to derive an accurate vector to the star. An alternative means of deriving a vector to the star is to manoeuvre the spacecraft so that the star crosses the X and Y lines, marking each time it does so. It is this method that Mission Control are not wanting the crew to use as it means taking the spacecraft out of its current attitude.
076:27:55|The LM windows have lines painted on both the inside and outside. If the commander positions his head in just the right place, the two sets of lines line up for him. In this position, they become relevant to the operation of the Landing Point Designator (LPD). This is a routine in the computer that is run during the approach phase of a landing and it allows the computer to indicate to what spot on the ground it is flying the LM to. If the commander doesn't like this spot, he has the ability to redesignate by moving his controller. The LPD lines are formed from a horizontal line that matches the view directly forward, and a vertical line calibrated in degrees down from the horizontal.
076:28:19|This refers to the Time of Ignition.
076:32:52|They are drawing from pre-existing abort plans to decide the conditions under which the PC+2 maneuver should be stopped. These include abnormal fuel pressure, movement outside their set limits for the attitude, as well as failures in the power system, the guidance computer, or the control electronics.
076:32:52|Lunar Orbit Insertion Mode I abort scenario assumes that instead of LOI maneuver behind the Moon, they continue past the LOI point and perform the abort burn at PC+2 point.
076:32:52|The various Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) abort scenarios are presented in a table in the Flight Plan, should they be needed to cancel the maneuver to enter lunar orbit. These were designated for otherwise fully functional pair of spacecraft, rather than a LM hauling an inert CSM.
076:35:13|They are to use manual start should the engine not start automatically. If the PC+2 does not succeed, they have an opportunity to try again two hours later.
076:35:13|If for some reason the PC+2 burn fails to happen completely. they are still on the free return trajectory they established earlier, and would end up splashing down into the Indian Ocean at 152 hours GET.
076:39:35|Fred's Freudian slip can surely be excused here.
076:42:07|Each crewman has a personal flashlight, and there are two spares in the Command Module.
076:42:45|The long-awaited lunar shadow is making the false stars caused by the surrounding debris to disappear, leaving the real stars to become visible.
076:45:47|Vance Brand is reminding them that since they have modified the DAP programming by acccessing the code in the computer memory, they will have to re-program it to return to the usual values for the DAP deadband.
076:58:32|Jim is reminding his crewmates of the high stakes of the PC+2 maneuver. Those 10 hours off their travel time back home could be the difference between survival and being lost in space.
077:04:06|Jim is still itching to do some star sightings for a platform alignment.
077:08:08|The last topic caught on the comm loop before Loss of Signal is Jim talking about food.
077:08:08|Apollo 13 has slipped beyond radio contact. Normally this would be the time of feverish waiting in Mission Control, to learn of the news whether the spacecraft was able to burn its SPS engine behind the Moon to put them on a lunar orbit. This time they are only swinging around, already on the free return trajectory.
|It is 77 and a half hours into the mission of Apollo 13. A little over 20 hours earlier, the explosion of the number 2 oxygen tank in the Service Module not only cancelled their lunar landing mission to Fra Mauro but has put the lives of the three astronauts in jeopardy. Now camped out in the Lunar Module Aquarius serving as their lifeboat, the Apollo 13 spacecraft stack is making its only pass of the far side of the Moon. They have done a brief burn using the Descent Propulsion System in the Lunar Module normally used to land on the Moon, and plan to do a larger burn two hours after their closest approach to the Moon. This PC+2 or "pericynthion + 2" burn is intended to take 10 hours away from their return time and hence give them a more comfortable reserve of electric power, cooling water and breathing oxygen for the return leg of the mission.
|Apollo 13 has disappeared behind the Moon and will be outside radio contact for approximately 25 minutes. It is not known if the crew or the people following them in Mission Control realized that their free return trajectory swung them around the Moon in a manner that put them the furthest away from Earth than any other manned space mission, a record still to be broken to this day. This is Jim Lovell's second time breaking that record, having done so for the first time in 1968 during Apollo 8 when he was part of the crew that was the first to depart Earth orbit and head for the Moon.
|AS13-62-8923 shows Mare Moscoviense as the dark feature. This picture is looking towards the North pole of the Moon, with east to the left. Named for Moscow. Crates around the Mare are named for Russian cosmonauts. Prominent is the crater Komarov, named for the cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov (1927-1967) who died during the first test flight of the Soyuz spacecraft.
|Lunar surface map showing Mare Moscoviense. It is located on the farside of the moon around 30 &deg; North latitude and 150 &deg; East longitude. (NASA/LPI)
077:34:37|The Apollo astronauts are right on time.
077:35:05|The radio signal is not perfect, but workable.
077:39:31|Lovell is observing Mare Smythii on the far side of the Moon, located roughly about the zero &deg; latitude (lunar equator) and between 80 &deg; and 90 &deg; East longitude. It is named for the British astronomer William Henry Smyth (1788-1865)
077:41:08|They are slowly moving away from the Moon, and instead of a flatness that dominates their view, they are already at a distance where the curvature of the lunar surface is becoming evident.
077:41:37|Mare Crisium - the Sea of Crises- is located westwards of Mare Smythii and is on the nearside of the Moon. Its rough location is between 10 &deg; and 25 &deg; North in latitude and between 50 to 70 &deg; East in longitude. (NASA/LPI)
077:41:44|Jim is referring to the 250mm objective they have available for their Hasselblad electric camera carried onboard.
077:41:44|The lunar far side looks very different from the near side because it lacks the huge, dark basalt plains known as maria that characterise the near side. Instead it is dominated by heavily impacted, light-toned highland landscape. One of the most distinctive features therefore is Tsiolkovsky, a 180-km crater with a dark, mare-like floor and impressive light-toned central peak. Being 20&deg; south, it has not been well viewed during earlier missions which have hugged the Moon at only 60nm (110 km) and stayed close to the equator.
077:41:44|Two photos from Apollo 13 were especially striking, as seen here.
077:41:44|Jim's earlier flight, Apollo 8, did capture good shots of the crater.
077:41:44|The very dark Crater Tsiolkovsky is located on the farside with its center around 20 &deg; South latitude and 127 &deg; East longitude. It is named for Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935), the Russian physicist and rocket theory pioneer. (NASA/LPI)
077:42:08|It is likely they are referring to the fact that that the cold temperature of the cabin is causing condensation to form on the windows, fogging them up. They have electric heaters that can be used to clear them, but they obviously will not dare to spend any of their battery power to operate them. Each of the heaters consumes as much power 2.5 amps - same as the guidance computer!
077:44:55|Jim recalled his compatriots' photographic enthusiasm later on as well.
077:44:55|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">Apollo Expeditions to the Moon (NASA SP-350, 1975):</span></b> &quot;Suddenly, I noticed that Swigert and Haise had their cameras out and were busy photographing the lunar surface. I looked at them incredulously and said, "If we don't make this next maneuver correctly, you won't get your pictures developed!" They said, "Well, you've been here before and we haven't." Actually, some of the pictures these tourists took turned out to be very useful.&quot;
077:44:56|It sounds like Jim is ushering his crewmates on by suggesting that their unaltered return time of 152 hours GET is unacceptable.
077:53:58|They are modifying this page of the checklist. Instead of using the fuel quantity as their cue to turn off the fuel pressurization helium, they are using the elapsed time of the burn.
077:59:17|Fred has punched in the power amplifier on the S-Band radio to get a better signal for this important talk.
077:59:50|The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> This PAD is the final version for a burn of the LM's main engine approximately two hours after pericynthion (their closest approach to the Moon) in order to return them to a specific place on Earth; in this case the Mid-Pacific Landing site or MPL, and to do so faster than would have been the case with just a unmodified free-return trajectory.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b> 79 hours, 27 minutes, 38.3 seconds.<br> <b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, +833.0 (+253.9); y, -50.9 (-15.5); z, -213.9 (-65.2). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal).<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub>, expected apogee of resulting orbit (Noun 42):</b> Not applicable. This burn is to place Apollo 13 on a, Earth-bound trajectory, the apogee of which would be over 9999.9 nautical miles, beyond the limit of the computer's display.<br> <b>H<sub>P</sub>, expected perigee of resulting orbit (Noun 42):</b> 20.5 nautical miles (38.0 km). The perigee distance is so low, it will take the spacecraft well into Earth's atmosphere and thereby, the spacecraft will re-enter.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>R</sub>:</b> 861.5 fps (262.6 m/s). This is the total resultant change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 4 minutes, 24 seconds.<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b> Roll, 272&deg;; Pitch, 81&deg;. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform and is therefore set using the FDAI display in its inertial mode. Unlike a CSM PAD, yaw is not stated for the LM. Procedures for a lunar landing allowed the spacecraft to yaw around the thrust axis as required for operational reasons.<br> <b>CSM mass:</b> 62,480 pounds (28,340 kg). <b>LM mass:</b> 33,452 pounds (15,174 kg).
077:59:50|Additional notes include a so-called 'ullage' burn to settle the propellants at the bottom of their tanks by burning two of their RCS thrusters for ten seconds. The throttle settings that should be used during the burn are; 5 seconds at 10% thrust to give the computer time to sense if the GDA angles ought to be trimmed. The next 21 seconds will be at a 40% setting with the rest at full throttle. Retro expects that this burn should result in a splashdown time of 142:47 GET.
078:02:06|<b>Expected splashdown point (Noun 61):</b> 21.65&deg; south, 165.0&deg; west; in the mid-Pacific. This would later be decremented based on data from the EMS' own accelerometer.<br> <b>Range to go:</b> 1,163.5 nautical miles (2,154.8 km). To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel after Entry Interface. This would later be decremented based on the data from the accelerometer.<br> <b>Expected velocity at Entry Interface:</b> 36,292 fps (11,062 m/s).<br> <b>Time of Entry Interface:</b> 142 hours, 39 minutes and 22 seconds GET. This is the predicted time at which the spacecraft would be at 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude.<br> <b>GDC align stars:</b> The stars to be used for GDC align purposes are the north set, Deneb and Vega. The align angles are roll, 7&deg;; pitch, 144&deg;; yaw, 68&deg;.
078:02:25|As planned, the previously troublesome S-IVB stage has impacted the Moon and the effect of the impact is being detected by the Apollo 12 seismometer. This is the first time this had been attempted during the Apollo program.
078:02:25|Seismologists usually characterised the Moon's response to these impacts as 'ringing like a bell'.
078:03:58|Nunki is the navigation star 37, also known as Sigma Sagittarii.
078:04:53|By 'posigrade', the PAO means that the burn will be used to add velocity, instead of slowing them down.
078:08:33|They plan to power down the spacecraft immediately after the PC+2 burn to prepare for the long coast home, using as little of their power and water as posible.
078:10:08|The PRE AMPS warning light indicates an issue with the power supply to the control electronics, but they know the issue and are not worried about it. They simply haven't put the circuit breaker in.
078:18:39|They have powered up the electronics for receiving the data update on their computer. It contains the state vector as derived by the ground-based tracking - their exact position information.
078:22:15|It is extremely important for Mission Control to get good ranging data at this moment, to ensure that they can support the upcoming burn and make it as accurate as possible to get them home.
078:29:51|The crew had a procedure read to them earlier on how to pressurize the water tank in the Command Module by using the surge tank oxygen pressure. Mission Control has no way to measure how much water is being used by the crew, and needs the crew to keep them up to date on their drinking so that they can estimate how much water they have left.
078:31:08|80 ounces is about 2.3 liters of water. If this is all water they've had access to since the accident happened about 22 hours previously, each of them has consumed only 0.7 liters or so, which is very little daily intake for a healthy adult male. It is not known exactly how much they were drinking at this point, but they would soon be suffering from dehydrated as a result of drinking too little water out of fear of running out.
078:31:23|This is 1,563 metres per second. After passing the Moon, the lunar gravity is now slowing them down as it tries to pull them back towards itself.
078:36:43|The 'flashing 99' being discussed refers to VERB 99 (ENABLE ENGINE IGNITION) which would be displayed on the DSKY, and requires them to press the PRO button to star the engine under automatic computer control.
078:41:42|Fred's question shows that the poor radio quality is affecting their communication to a degree that misunderstandings are a real possiblity and a danger they have to take into account.
079:07:38|With Jim at his station on the left side of the LM s that the two sets of LPD lines line up, the full Moon appears to be centred on the 14-degree mark, a useful check of their attitude
079:08:08|Vance suggests that to give them a rough reference on whether their attitude is correct, they can look at how the Moon is lined up on the targeting lines on his window.
079:08:48|To be more specific, Jim named the mountain after his wife, Marilyn Lovell.
079:08:48|This photograph was taken during Apollo 10. It shows the CSM Charlie Brown in lunar orbit as seen from the LM Snoopy. Beyond the CSM in the upper right of this picture is a triangular feature. This is Mount Marilyn and it is 110 kilometres east of the crater Secchi.
079:08:48|Mt Marilyn is located on the Secchi ridge that separates The Sea of Tranquility from the Sea of Fertility, to the southeast. In 2017, <a href="https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/15617?__fsk=-898556293" target="_blank">the International Astronomical Union (IAU) approved this</a> as the official name of this lunar landmark. They cite AFJ creator W. David Woods' book "How The Apollo Flew to the Moon" as a reference for the naming.
079:08:48|Marilyn Lovell and Mary Haise were present in Mission Control to view the last TV broadcast, just before the accident. They'd just left for home and only learned of it later.
079:18:20|It's 8:36 pm in Houston. Many astronauts have once again come to Mission Control to be at the center of action for the crucial PC+2 burn. Frank Borman, mentioned here as Jim Lovell's Commander for two of his past missions, would have been working as a special White House representative at the moment, informing President Nixon of the progress of the mission.
079:24:26|At this distance they have to take the speed of light - and their radio waves - into account, besides the speed of human fingers!
079:26:46|It is a quiet time on the radio, with the crew concentrated on their final actions before the burn. Things that will happen before ignition are the ENGINE ARM selection, the ullage to settle the propellants in the DPS tanks, and prepare for giving the computer the clearance to fire the engine by pressing the PRO button.
079:28:36|The DPS engine has reached 100% power, delivering 10,500 pounds or 46.7 kilonewtons in thrust. The DPS' ability to have its thrust level altered was unique in the Apollo program - no other engine used during the mission had this capacity. It was a big technical challenge to design an engine capable of having its performance adjusted while in operation. The solution reached was a series of flow constrictors in the fuel injector system that could be used to meter the amount of propellant allowed into the engine, to be burnt.
079:28:36|While innovative in design and sufficient for the purposes of the lunar landing mission, the DPS throttle is not withouts its limitations. The allowed engine operation zones are 10% to 60% and 90% or up, with the levels between 60 and 90% considered to be unusable. At this power level, the engine was known to burn the ablative lining inside the engine nozzle at a higher rate than otherwise, which would result in the engine destroying itself eventually.
079:29:58|What the PAO means, they can read the Program 40 DSKY displays in Mission Control via the telemetry.
079:29:58|They are about halfway through the 4:24 burn and have achieved more than half of their desired 861.5 feet per second [262.6 m/s] Delta-V.
079:32:31|Verb 16, Noun 40 means the DSKY is displaying the velocity still to be gained (hopefully a very small number) and their accumulated Delta-V, both of which Houston can see via telemetry.
079:32:41|Upon pressing the PRO button again, the DSKY displays the contents of NOUN 85. The three numbers in the displays represent the velocity to be gained in each of the three cartesian coordinates. If the reading is negative, it means the engine burn overshot the desired velocity change along that axis. These numbers are known as the residuals. Depending on the situation, further burns may be made using the spacecraft's RCS thrusters to bring these residuals to zero, known as nulling the residuals. In this case, because they are not manoeuvring very close to the Moon, they will leave the residuals alone. The values on the DKSY are +1 fps in X, +0.3 in Y and zero in Z. These are extremely small values, of only centimeters per second.
079:33:18|Jim understands that after the high power use during the PC+2 maneuver, their power load needs to come down so that they can save as much battery charge as possible. Their electric load peaked around 50 amps during the DPS burn, with all the high power equipment running.
079:37:24|Fred's question is another show that precision in terminology can be crucial in their communication.
079:38:02|Although the crew is ready to proceed, Mission Control is holding back while they ruminate on what to do next.
079:44:48|They have a pre-existing plan for powering down the LM systems, but modifications are made that mostly reflect their current situation and equipment being used. They will not use the VHF and will leave it off as well as the power amplifier, a configuration that they already are using. The interior lights will stay off. They will also not switch their attitude control to "Direct" which would mean manually firing the RCS jets, but let them remain under the control of the computer for now.
079:45:31|The Contingency Checklist has diagrams of the circuit breaker panels that can be used as a quick reference on how to configure all the 178 breakers to the requested state. They are doing several modifications again however. They want to keep the RCS thrusters and the guidance system powered for the moment.
079:47:49|Fred thinks that since they are not using the Ascent Stage batteries, they should not have the associated ECA control electronics box powered.
079:48:41|These breakers keep the other half of the RCS jets powered.
079:49:17|Power 7 shows the LMP's side of the circuit breaker panels, and its desired configuration.
079:49:52|This will remove power from the radio signal amplifier from the electrical distribution point of view instead of just using the power switch.
079:52:06|Jim removing the inverters from the power bus means that they are turning off the AC power needed by the FDAI 8-ball.
079:52:11|They are reverting back to using the computer screen for their attitude reference by having it display the gimbal angles.
079:54:06|The cabin fan is mostly used for cooling the LM cockpit, and is not crucial, especially when they want to save power and their temperature is already low. It is the suit fans inside the life support system that circulate the cabin air through the lithium hydroxide canister to scrub the atmosphere.
079:56:01|With Mission Control monitoring them via telemetry, Fred thinks they can save that power as well.
079:57:05|Turning off power to the ASA, or the Abort Sensor Assembly, would effectively write it off. Losing temperature control in the ASA will likely either degrade their performance, or disable the system completely.
079:57:39|This maneuver effectively tips them 90 degrees backwards, thinking in terrestial terms.
079:58:54|They wish to use the computer to maintain their position after their maneuver by configuring for the Digital Autopilot again.
079:58:54|To disable the plus-X RCS thrusters, Vance offers the crew a procedure to do via the computer. To do so, they input Verb 25 Noun 07 (LOAD COMPONENT - CHANNEL/FLAG WORD OPERATOR in order to access the computer’s routine for automatic control of the RCS thrusters. By identifying to location of the instruction they want to modify, they are able to set the individual bit that controls the status of the RCS thrusters. Since binary language has only two states, 1 and 0, it is most logical that something like the status of a rocket engine can be indicated by the state of an individual bit, considering such a piece of equipment too only has two states, on or off. For this particular action, they access location 1257 and the 'CH5MASK' routine there.
079:58:54|This is another show of the remarkable nature of the Apollo Guidance Computer, in that the crew could at times be asked to manipulate individual bits in the computer memory to have the desired effect on the operation of the spacecraft.
080:05:01|Brand is reminding Jim that, because he won't be able to use the FDAI (8-ball) to see his attitude, he will need to use the attitude numbers as stored in the computer and displayed on the DSKY. The DSKY has three 5-digit displays for outputting values which often come in threes (e.g. X, Y and Z or roll, pitch and yaw). These register displays are known as R1, R2 and R3.
080:11:13|By ‘going in’, Fred is referring to programming the computer to not to use the plus-X (downwards-pointing) RCS thrusters for the moment. He mentions masking, too, in reference to the CH5MASK flag in the computer in the procedure that was read up to them a moment earlier.
080:11:50|For most of the time, only one of the crewmembers onboard the LM is wearing a headset hooked up to the radio. They are not all in the loop, as usual, but have to share information among themselves onboard.
080:12:53|Fred is lamenting the brief time they used the AGS so far.
080:16:52|It is 9:30 pm in Houston, which is the time that the crew is using as well. References to terrestial time are relatively rare during the Apollo missions, with the crews living Ground Elapsed Time, rather.
080:18:49|The Ron Howard movie substituted Jim's line here with a "We just put Sir Isaac Newton in the driver's seat" - most likely for the more dramatic effect to imply that their journey is now controlled by the laws of physics, rather than their computer.
080:18:49|It is likely that the scriptwriters were looking back at a comment made by Apollo 8's LMP William Anders during their return from the Moon, when he quipped to CapCom Michael Collins that "I think Isaac Newton is doing most of the driving right now."
080:19:09|Fred is referring to Program 37, which is the CSM computer program that will calculate their entry trajectory. The Lunar Module's guidance computer understandably does not have such programming installed.
080:20:13|The craters they are observing are ones located near to their planned landing area of Fra Mauro. They would be familiar landmarks for them to spot while coming along their lunar orbit, heading towards west while coming from behind the Moon. Ptolemaeus is named after the Greek astronomer and polymath Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy). (c. 87-150 CE). Alphonsus is named for Alfonso X of Castile (1221-1284), the Spanish ruler and astronomer. Herschel is named after Sir William Herschel (1738-1822), the German-born British astronomer who is best known for his discovery of Uranus. His sister Caroline and his son John also have lunar craters named after them.
080:20:13|This map shows the intended landing site of Apollo 13 in Fra Mauro as well as the landing sites of Apollo 12 and Apollo 11. This highlights quite well the narrow area on the lunar surface that could be targeted by the Apollo landings.
080:20:25|The infamous "square peg in the round hole" dilemma is being processed in Mission Control. They will soon present with a most remarkable solution to the issue.
080:21:55|As a bit of extra redundancy, the LiOH cartridges in the PLSS backpacks are compatible with the LM's ARS - Atmospheric Rejuvenation System. Fred is reminding Vance that they could take them out of the PLSS packs and use them on the LM's life support system instead.
080:22:50|It sounds like Jim saw pieces of the foil-like insulation glittering in the sunlight, before they disappeared behind the Moon.
080:26:00|Conventionally, a spacecraft's manoeuvring thrusters are arranged around its centre of mass and their operation has well-understood results. The situation Jim now finds himself in is that he needs to manoeuvre a stack which has a 28-ton mass hanging off one end and such manoeuvres had not been practiced. The centre of mass of the stack is well away from the thrusters and therefore, their operation does not produce the expected result. Jim and Fred are working it together.
080:29:00|They have two ways of changing their attitude, the ACA hand controller and the TTCA hand controller. The latter produces thrust in a way that can alter their trajectory, and they want to be sparing on that. Too much, and they could be off course.
080:30:53|Top of the LMP's console has a bank of caution and warning lights, including those for the Environmental Control System. The ECS light goes on if various parts of the system fails. Now it has lit up due to the increased carbon dioxide level.
080:31:37|There is a separate warning light on the bottom of the right side of the main console. This CO<sub>2</sub> is known as the component light and is designed to light when the amount of carbon dioxide exceeds 7.6 mmHg.
080:32:14|Vance is using the full name of the measurement, 'partial pressure carbon dioxide'.
080:36:01|Jim is referring to the sun visor that is slipped on top of his helmet. His comment could be interpreted that something was placed inside for him to find.
080:36:25|Fred is bidding farewell to their mission objective, now slowly slipping away from them.
080:39:27|The crew is anxious to get the adapter started, but Vance is holding back. They know that while important, it is not something they have to - or should - do in a hurry. The CO<sub>2</sub> situation is not immediatley critical.
081:03:47|It sounds like Jim is starting to feel his exhaustion after the excitement of the PC+2 burn.
081:18:36|This is the procedure to program the computer to stop the downwards-facing RCS jets from firing.
081:20:09|Verb 16, Noun 20 brings up the current gimbal angles on the DSKY's three register displays. In this mode, R1 shows the outer gimbal angle, R2 is the inner gimbal angle and R3 is the middle gimbal angle. The angles are displayed to an accuracy of two decimal places.
081:20:56|Jim is concerned about their supply of drinking water and food. The water is a precarious balance between what they are drinking and what the spacecraft’s cooling system requires. Although the Command Module water is not currently being used to cool the LM, Jim is taking into account the possibility that at some point they will have to use the drinking water supply for that purpose. He is loathe to spend too much of it until he knows that they will get back on what they have onboard.
081:20:56|Jim expresses additional worries about the food. He thinks that at their current situation, only the ready to eat and snack-type foods are really suitable for consumption. The rehydratable foods require water to be added before eating, and although they could use part of their drinking water for this purpose and consume that water as part of the meal, reconstituting the food with just cold water would make eating it an unpleasant experience. Even if they had the power to spare to run the water heater, it is located in the Command Module. The Lunar Module has always been designed to cater only cold foods to her crew.
081:20:56|Lovell also mentions ‘wet packs’ - these were foil-sealed TV-meal type ready to eat portions that were kept in a cold box inside the Command Module and heated in an electric heater before being eaten. He thinks that they are good to eat, but does not elaborate on how they would prepare them without power.
081:20:56|The spoon bowl package was a development on the original freeze dried food bags designed for Apollo. The port on the bottom of the bag was used to introduce hot water into the bag, which was then kneaded and allowed to set for a few minutes. Afterwards the top could be opened and the contents eaten rather conventionally with a spoon, rather than squeezed out. The moisture of the food serves as a natural glue to stick the food into the spoon and stop it from floating into the cabin.
081:20:56|To supplement the other food , some of the provisions were packaged in a ready to eat form. Various foodstuffs were carefully treated - chemically, biologically, even radiologically! - and then sealed in plastic to prevent spoiling at normal room temperature in the cabin. They required no preparation and could be eaten simply by opening the package. The crew usually enjoyed them, due to the texture and flavor being relatively well preserved, compared to the freeze dried food. Still, it is no surprise that a lot of them were confectionaries, such as cake, to make them more palatable.
081:22:34|Jim is likely referring to the Oxygen Purge System (OPS), a unit that was to be attached to the top of a PLSS before an EVA on the lunar surface. The PLSS had its own tank of oxygen to keep a crewman supplied with breatable air during an EVA. But if there were to be a breach in the suit, the OPS could be activiated to flood the suit with additional oxygen. If the breach wasn't too large, this would maintain suit pressure while the crew got back into the safety of the LM.
081:22:34|The OPS package contained two storage spheres that held a total of 2.3 kg of oxygen at a pressure of nearly 6,000 psi. This extremely high pressure was likely why Jim referred to the PLSS being a bomb. The primary oxygen supply also came from a high-pressure tank but this was only at a quarter of the OPS spheres.
081:28:03|A situation of confusion exists between the crew and Mission Control over dumping waste water. Mission Control thinks the crew is doing so, while the crew thinks that the order not to dump is a permanent one.
081:34:17|Vance is referring to science astronaut Tony England, who has been supporting the mission, as well as the familiar CapCom astronaut Jack Lousma.
081:34:17|It was important for Jack to be involved, considering that it was hoped that someone who had built one of the adapters would be the one to tell the crew of Apollo 13 how to build one onboard the Aquarius!
081:34:47|Albeit the LiOH situation is a concern, they still have plenty of capacity left in the LM system before they are forced to switch over to their self-built backup.
081:35:42|It sounds like Fred is observing Earth weather.
081:38:09|This scan from Apollo 13 LM Contingency Checklist shows the amperages of the PGNS components. Turning off the platform and the computer saves them 10 amps per hour, essentially halving their power consumption.
081:42:30|Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus are two large dominant craters near the centre of the Moon's nearside disk. The fact that the crew can see them indicates that they are seeing more of the near side.<br> <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/images/print/AS13/60/8701.jpg" target="new"><img src="photos/as13-60-8701-label.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="AS13-60-8701 with craters indicated."></a><br> Portion of AS13-60-8701 with Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus indicated, as photographed from Apollo 13.<br> <i>(Click image to see full version.)</i><br> Alphonsus is notable because it has three distinctive dark patches around the edge of the crater floor, thought to be volcanic in origin.
081:45:19|Fred is peering around with the AOT, but has been caught with the Command Module blocking his view.
081:46:13|A table produced after the mission shows a listing of the critical LM consumables and their usage during each hour of operation, and the expected time they are to last. These varied according to their present use, of course.
081:49:34|The water and the power usage are intimately tied. Improving one will improve the other. Less power use means less heat to be transmitted out of the spacecraft, which requires water.
081:51:19|The Command Module battery status is of utmost interest to all of them. Their return to Earth is dependent on how much power they have left for use for reentry.
081:51:19|Oxygen is not a crucial item at the moment. The LM has an ample supply, due to the reserve carried for repressurizing the cabin after two lunar surface EVAs. Since this is not to be done, they have plenty of oxygen to last the return home, three people in the LM or not.
081:52:00|Since the crash of Main Bus B was the first sign of the trouble onboard the ship, they are concerned that this half of the power distribution system might be permanently damaged.
081:53:23|This is the first, and only extended description of the accident heard on the air to ground loop. Neither Mission Control nor the crew is eager to dwell.
081:56:14|Jack is wondering whether they plan to perform Earth atmospheric reentry under Command Module Computer control, or with the crew manually guiding them with information derived from the EMS display.
081:56:42|View into Mission Control. Seated are Flight Directors Glynn Lunney and Gerald Griffin. Standing up in a suit is Apollo 9 astronaut and then Apollo program manager Jim McDivitt. Deke Slayton on the right, looking at the other men.
081:56:51|Jack is surprised to hear their Chief on the comm loop.
081:58:00|They have a lasting concern that the oxygen being drained to get the water out of the Command Module tank will limit their oxygen supply usable for the Earth landing.
081:58:00|If we assume that the 22 water bags are 8 ounces each, as mentioned before, this makes about 5.2 liters of water currently for the crew to drink.
081:58:49|Joking or not, Jack is not wrong. He is the first CMP to spend a considerable time in the Lunar Module, let alone be command of it. He also makes a reference to the barrel-like shape of the Ascent Engine cover, which served as his station during the times all three crewmembers were in <i>Aquarius</i>.
081:58:49|The comment about the DPS burn was heard on the air to ground loop by reporters, who later asked Flight Director Gene Kranz about it during his post-shift press conference. Kranz claimed that since the burn had been computed with two crewmen in the LM and one in the CM, the Descent Engine gimbals had to compensate for the change in the two spacecraft's center of gravity due to Swigert's presence, to a degree that it was noticeable in the burn telemetry. Upon being asked to speculate why Swigert joined his two crewmates in the LM for the burn, Kranz suggested that "I think the third man just wanted to see what was going on."
081:59:55|It sounds like Jack is wondering about the plan for the Earth re-entry using the Command Module Computer for guidance control. He is wondering how they can get the CM's guidance platform set up properly.
082:03:11|They are removing power from the RCS jet quads as well as the control electronics.
082:04:41|IMU OPERATE breaker supplies power into the inertial platform. Once they remove that power they will lose their carefully preserved gimbal attitude reference. As a result, with the power out to the IMU, Houston can't see the Coupling Data Unit information. The CDU interfaces between the IMU and the LM computer, and their attitude information is derived from it in Mission Control as well. They've been using this data to determine when to ask them to switch antennas, too, but now it will be up to the crew to do the switching.
082:05:36|This pulls the power from the RCS quad heaters. They leave the IMU heater on to preserve the platform for further use.
082:07:36|To save a little bit of power, they will only leave one comm panel operational.
082:08:50|They have been making sure that the displays are unpowered throughout the emergency phase of the mission, and Jim doesn't want to repeat the whole list.
082:16:16|The "hardover" mode refers to an emergency mode on the RCS thrusters, where turning the TTCA hand controller to the max position fires the RCS jets. This could damage the units if the RCS quads are not at their normal operational temperatures. A minimum of 15 minutes of RCS heaters running is required.
082:16:16|POWER-8 page of the Contingency checklist gives a rundown on the systems that remain operational during emergency powered down conditions. Their configurations is similar to this except that the VHF radio and the onboard readouts are eliminated - the VHF due to being useless at this range, and the cabin displays since Mission Control is taking care of monitoring the systems via telemetry.
082:16:45|Lousma assures Jim that their plans for a non-computer-guided maneuver are sound.
082:22:43|The LM was launched with one faulty circuit breaker that was left in the closed position, as it was needed.
082:23:19|They plan to keep controlling the RCS heaters with the switches instead of the power circuit breakers.
082:25:47|Jim's concern is not unwarranted. A major symptom of carbon dioxide poisoning is sedation and loss of consciousness. They might fall asleep and not wake up anymore.
082:25:55|Their carbon dioxide levels are usually kept close to zero. They are pushing the limits of safety, but are alright so far.
082:26:04|The top of the LM's console has the displays for the ECS, including the current CO<sub>2</sub> level.
082:28:32|For once it's Jack who gets the jokes from Mission Control, instead of Fred.
|Apollo 13 is 10 hours into the fourth day of the abortive mission. A few hours earlier, the crew performed the PC+2 burn to gain further speed after their slingshot around the moon, to hasten their landing to approximately 142 hours GET. They have also powered down the LM Aquarius' systems, including the guidance computer. They are now coasting away from the Moon at a slowly decreasing speed until the gravitational influence of the Earth will grab hold of them and they begin to accelerate again. While things are stable for the moment, the rising carbon dioxide levels are a continuing worry.
082:37:38|The power expenditure calculations were made conservatively with 14 amps per hour as the baseline, but they are beating that and creating a surplus much to everyone’s delight.
082:38:18|It is a quarter to midnight in Houston, and the Maroon Team under Milton Windler is manning Mission Control. It was Jack on the CapCom seat also during the oxygen tank explosion, when everyone was starting to settle in for a quiet night shift. His two previous shifts covered the crew sleep period as well.
082:39:19|The CDU or Coupling Data Unit converts the analog electronic signals from the inertial platform into a digital form processed by the onboard computer. This data has been used by Mission Control to monitor their gimbal angles and hence has been useful in telling which of the two OMNI antennas is more favorable for communications.
082:44:17|Fred seems to be the recipient of all the moments of levity with Mission Control. Jack Lousma is especially keen to tease the crew in space to try and lighten their minds just a little.
082:47:32|Fred has spotted another leak from the Service Module. This could be potentially very serious, since any gas or fluid expelled from the spacecraft will impart a force acting like a rocket engine, and hence might disturb their trajectory. The damaged Service Module also appears to be still releasing debris as well. This could occlude their further attempts at sighting stars.
082:49:09|If the PTC rotation remains stable, this means that they can keep switching antennas at leisure and maintain constant contact.
082:49:56|Knowing whether they have been leaking for a longer period would be very important. It could have been altering their trajectory for quite some time.
082:50:49|Fred is extremely pleased to hear that they are running ahead of the curve, so to speak. Mission Control has been calculating the remaining battery power on a 14-amp per hour usage, but the ship is actually using less, which means they are running on a positive balance for the moment.
082:51:01|With hardover, Jack is referring to the bypass mode on the RCS that will fire them when the hand controller is moved to the maximum position.
082:51:35|Fred is most likely thinking that the only thing that would require them to perform immediate maneuvers would be a threatening gimbal lock. With the IMU platform shut down, this is no longer the case. He also notes that under normal operations, the RCS quads need to be warmed up with the heaters for at least 15 minutes before they are to be used.
082:51:54|They have powered down the actual warning lights panel, while the caution and warning system remains operational. This means that if there is an alert, they will first have to push in the circuit breaker to see the indicators actually light up.
082:51:54|Mission Control is keeping an eye on some of the temperature-critical components of the Lunar Module. the PIPAs are Pulsed Integrating Pendulous Accelerometers and are part of the IMU. The ASA, or the Abort Sensor Assembly contains similar equipment used by the Abort Guidance System. Both will suffer degrading performance if their temperature drops below their tolerance levels.
082:51:54|They are also watching the propellants, except those on the big tanks in the Descent Stage. The RCS jets are also under the watchful eye of Mission Control. They turned off the quad heaters earlier.
082:52:50|El Lago is a community only about 10 minutes' drive away from Johnson Space Center (Then known as The Manned Spacecraft Center) in Houston. It was the home of many astronauts active at the time, none the least Jack Lousma, Fred Haise, Vance Brand, Tom Stafford and John W. Young. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin lived there as well.
082:54:13|Engineering tests show that if there are no carbon dioxide scrubbers operational, the levels may rise up to 9.64 mmHg per hour. With 16 as absolutely limit to operation, the cabin atmosphere could become dangerously saturated within an hour and 22 minutes. By the sounds of the speed with which their levels are rising, their current scrubber canister is already very much used up.
082:55:08|A leak in the inert Service Module is much less critical than having something leak out of the Command Module or the Lunar Module.
082:57:30|Fred is talking about the battery-powered Hasselblad 70mm film camera. It's also known as the EL camera occasionally.
082:57:30|The DC camera is likely referring to the Maurer 16mm film movie camera in the Command module.
082:57:30|Another 70mm film camera in the Command Module has the Reseau plate attached to it - the source of the familiar cross-shaped marks seen on many space photos. For a good explanation of the Reseau plate you can click here in our affliate publication the ALSJ:
082:58:14|The surface camera is similar to the 70mm cameras for use onboard the spacecraft, but specially modified to be operated while wearing a spacesuit, and attached to the chest of the suit.
083:01:34|Tony England mentioned in the latest PAO update is a scientist astronaut hired in 1967 as part of Astronaut Group 6. He served as a member of the astronaut support team for Apollo 13, which included working on the carbon dioxide canister adapter he would show off in this press briefing. Truncated Apollo would not offer him an opportunity to fly in space, but he would eventually get a Space Shuttle mission in 1985, STS-51-F onboard the Challenger.
083:29:52|Fred is being instructed to use the surface camera to photograph the Moon at will. Settings for this include using the 1/250th of a second for shutter speed and f-stop numbers 4, 5.6 and 8. F-stop numbers indicate the lens speed being used.
083:29:52|Other interesting pieces of information are being relayed down as well. Mission Control is still working on their entry plans, plus they plan to perform a procedure to check Main Bus B in the Command Module. Considering it was the first part of the electrical system to show problems during their emergency, Mission Control is concerned that there could be permanent damage to Main Bus B that would write it off.
083:29:52|The upcoming midcourse correction and their configuration for it will become a major topic very soon.
083:31:11|Fred is spotting their planned landing zone, the Fra Mauro crater named after the Italian monk and astronomer. South of it are the Bonpland, named for Aimé Bonpland (1773-1858), a French botanist, and Parry, named for William Parry (1790-1855), a British explorer.
083:31:33|They're 30,028 kilometers away from the Moon and traveling at 1,371 m/s. The latest PAO update to mention these values at 81:45:00 GET put them at 21,459 km away and moving at 1,402 m/s. They've covered over 8,000 km while the lunar gravity has tugged at them to slow their velocity by a 30 m/s.
083:32:55|Teasing or not, Fred is not wrong. Mission Control has been extremely busy ever since the accident.
083:33:47|Fred is pleased to hear that his grounded crewmate Ken Mattingly has their backs covered.
083:48:15|At present, they are coming in slightly shallow, and Mission Control wants to steepen their entry angle to ensure they will hit the narrow corridor that will enable them to decelerate enough in the Earth atmosphere to land, instead of bouncing off the atmosphere and back to space.
083:48:20|38 pounds is 17.3 liters of water. This is the total capacity of the potable water tank, and implies that it was full at the time of the accident.
084:06:56|Joking aside, Fred is pleased with the way FIDO is working to determine their trajectory. Not only did they come up with a way to get reassurances on their inertial reference using the Sun check, but they have apparently also picked up the slight tumbling motion as well.
084:09:07|The CO<sub>2</sub> sensor is inside the suit circuit. It utilizes an beam of infrared light that is shone through a sample of the gas in the suit circuit. The amount of infrared light absorbed by the carbon dioxide is measured by the electronics and converted into a signal for the onboard display and to the telemetry that is radioed back to Earth.
084:15:22|A remarkable procedure is being put into use here to monitor the stability of the PTC rotation of the ship. Since the Earth and the Moon pass periodically behind the Commander’s window, they can use the LPD markings to determine the rough position of each body while the ship moves. If the position of the Earth or the Moon changes in relation to the numbered lines on the window, they can tell that the ship has moved out of its previous position.
084:28:02|Fred shows his remarkable adaptivity here by coming up with an extension of their makeshift attitude reference system, on the spot.
084:34:16|Fred is sounding exhausted. He might already be suffering from the effects of the urinary tract infection that is festering and will soon make him feel even worse.
084:56:28|Jack Lousma is suggesting that the astronauts, after their recovery by an aircraft carrier, will be flown by a helicopter to Samoa. From there they will take a Lockheed C-141 military cargo plane to the Ellington Air Force Base, a fifteen minutes' drive from Johnson Space Center in Texas.
085:09:04|Not only has the S-IVB impact triggered the seismometer, but it was also seen on the SIDE - Suprathermal Ion Detector Experiment, another part of the Apollo 12 surface experiments package.
085:09:58|Their distance, 37,780 km from the Moon, their velocity, 1,340 m/s.
085:16:19|Fred is suggesting their position is relatable to somewhere “between FPA 8 and Censorinus”. While the latter is a landmark crater near the Apollo 11 landing site, the meaning of FPA 8 remains unidentified.
085:22:14|The LM has two Lithium Hydroxide canister slots. The large one is the primary one, and they have now used the rotating controller above it to direct cabin air flow into the secondary canister.
085:30:01|The carbon dioxide levels have rapidly dropped, thanks to the new filter in place.
085:51:28|Onboard 16mm film shows Jim in the Lunar Module,yawning and rubbing his hands to get them warm. Without the electronics running on the Command Module and the LM mostly inert as well, the cabin temperatures have dropped to uncomfortable levels.
086:06:36|The Hycon camera is a very large piece of equipment, and weighs 58 pounds (26.3 kg) with its film magazine and lens attached.
086:07:06|The Command Module must be packed properly for the landing so as to have a predictable center of gravity. This is essential for them to have normal control functions during reentry and landing.
086:11:02|Despite this second assurance that they can drink the water freely, the crew will end up thirsty. The fruit juices mentioned are not independent beverages but in a powdered form that requires water to be added from the onboard supply.
086:31:10|Although it is important for them to get the canister adapter built sometime in the near future, it is not something that requires their immediate attention. Mission Control is trying their best to not to overload the tired astronauts, especially when they can be given the time to do things at a more leisurely pace, and allowing them to rest as well.
086:33:08|Mission Control has decided that even the lopsided PTC is good enough, and they don't want to go through the trouble - and power use - of getting the RCS back running for now.
086:33:59|This cutaway shows the different parts of the Service Module and what they contain. The most suspicious one for the moment is quadrant/sector/area number 4, which is the one open to space after the explosion.
087:06:46|This is, they will be burning with the spacecraft engine pointed at 90&deg; away from their trajectory to adjust the angle.
087:07:01|The plan is to power up the dormant Abort Guidance System and use it to run the 8-ball FDAI in the LM and use that for making their initial attitude changes for the burn. Just like in the Command Module, this critical instrument can receive its data either from the IMU or a backup source. In the LM this is the AGS and its ASA gyroscopes.
087:08:19|This scan from the Flight Operations Report shows the imagined view of the Earth as it would be seen through the COAS for the alignment for the MCC-7 burn.
087:09:35|The Y-axis goes through the sides of the Lunar Module. Hence what they want to accomplish is to have the spacecraft "upright" in relation to the Earth terminator so that when they look out of the window, the border between the day and night sides of the Earth is at a straight angle as seen in the earlier diagram.
087:11:38|The plan is to first adjust their attitude using the COAS and the terminator of the Earth as a visual reference to align their X and Y axes correctly. They will then input <b>ADDRESS 400 CODE +500000</b> to align the AGS AEA’s attitude reference to the XYZ axes of the LM.
087:11:38|On panel 3, they will select AGS to ATTITUDE HOLD. In this setting, the AGS will attempt to maintain the attitude detected for the spacecraft at the moment Attitude Hold was instated.
087:11:38|Selecting MODE CONTROL on the YAW axis means that AGS will be in automatic control of the spacecraft’s motions along the yaw or X axis. This is the axis that runs through the spacecraft from the top hatch to the engine nozzle at the bottom.
087:11:38|With ROLL AND PITCH in PULSE control setting, the crew will be in manual control of the spacecraft’s motions along those axes. This means that they are to manually change the spacecraft’s rotation along the axes that go through the side hatch and through the side of the spacecraft. This means tilting the spacecraft forward or backwards or left and right. They will use the TTCA hand controller to maintain control along these two axes. Pulse setting means that the RCS jets will be fired in very brief bursts.
087:13:15|The STAB/CONT switches in the control console will be used to select the attitude control options for the maneuver.
087:14:45|Because there will be no automatic control of the engine for the burn, they will have to flip open the protected ENGINE START button to operate the engine. The +X TRANSL button below it will be pressed for 10 seconds to fire the downwards-facing RCS thrusters and settle the DPS engine fuel in their tanks for the burn in manual ullage.
087:18:19|This somewhat unusual PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b>Midcourse correction to improve entry corridor angle. This is based on current best information and is provided in case communications are lost before the time of the burn.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b>135 hours, 59 minutes, 42.98 seconds. Issuing a Noun 33 value is arbitrary in this case since they are not using the computer to control the burn. It is simply used as a familiar term in filling the PAD. Timing will be performed manually.<br> <b>Change in velocity, fps (m/s) (Noun 81):</b> Not applicable. The change in velocity is usually resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal). However, this is burn is performed without the LGC that would perform the calculations based on the values given here. They will simply point their vehicle and fire the engine.<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> and <b>H<sub>P</sub></b> The apogee is not applicable since their trajectory is not an orbit around any spatial body but a reentry trajectory. The perigee is 20.5 miles (33 km), meaning that they will enter the Earth atmosphere.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>R</sub>:</b>19.3 fps (5.88 m/s). Normally this would be the the total resultant change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above. Since this will be a manual burn, the normal calculations are not applicable.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b>39 seconds.<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b> Roll, 008&deg;; Pitch, 000&deg; Attitude reference will be in the AGS, using body axis align. Sightings of Earth crescent with COAS will be used for further alignment. Unlike a CSM PAD, yaw is not stated for the LM. Procedures for a lunar landing allowed the spacecraft to yaw around the thrust axis as required for operational reasons.<br> <b>Change in velocity for the AGS (Noun 86):</b>N/A <br> <b>GDA angles:</b>N/A. These would be the angles to which the nozzle of the descent engine will be aimed to place its thrust axis through the stack's estimated centre of mass. It was noted earlier that burn will be made with the engine nozzle locked into place, hence nothing is recorded here.
087:18:19|Additional notes: DPS will be manually throttled to 10 percent thrust for the duration of the burn. Engine start and stop will be manual. Ullage will be manual and for 10 seconds using PLUS X TRANSLATIONAL controller. Pitch and yaw will be controlled manually using TTCA. Yaw axis will be controlled automatically in AGS ATTITUDE HOLD.
087:19:44|An empty example of a PAD sheet that they would use to fill in the information necessary for performing the burn.
087:21:00|The terminator-aligned burn was a backup method investigated during Jim's previous mission in 1968.
087:21:38|The CM Entry PADs are filled onto pre-printed sheets like this, in the CM Entry Checklist. The highlighted sections are the ones being filled in here.
087:23:46|The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b>Entry<br> <b>Latitude/longitude of splashdown point (Noun 61):</b> Latitude minus 021.62&deg;, longitude minus 165.37&deg; This is the estimated location of their splashdown. The EMS will decrement this based on their decceleration as sensed by the EMS accelerometer.<br> <b>Range to go to splashdown point from .05g event, nautical miles:</b>1182.9 nautical miles (2,190.7 km). This is the distance they are expected to travel once the EMS accelerometer senses .05g acceleration. This too will be decremented by the EMS based on their actual decceleration once they enter the Earth atmosphere.<br> <b>Predicted inertial velocity at .05g event,fps:</b>36,291 fps (11,061.5 m/s)This is the estimated velocity at the moment the EMS will sense .05g conditions and will trigger the entry monitoring sequence.<br> <b>GET of .05g point:</b>142 hours, 41 minutes, 30 seconds.
087:23:46|Additional notes: This partial Entry PAD contains information on their entry based on their trajectory altered by the upcoming midcourse 7.
087:46:43|AGS will have to be reset for each maneuver they plan to perform, by inputting the desired instructions into the DEDA panel.
087:49:46|Despite planning to use AGS for automatic control of their yaw axis, Jim receives instructions that the Attitude Controller Assembly or ACA hand controller can be used to adjust their attitude, if necessary.
087:51:37|The LRL is the Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston. It is a maximum biohazard facility for hosting the moon rocks and the crew after recovery. Jim, Fred and Jack were looking for three weeks in quarantine to protect Earth from possible contamination by moonborne organisms. Jim is now joking that since they did not land, the LRL personnel might as well go home.
087:56:20|This would be Judge Harry Blackmun (1908-1999), member of the Supreme Court from 1970 to 1994.
087:56:20|The air controller strike has been coming up in the crew's news updates ever since the launch. It was even joked that the flight controllers were thankfully not involved.
087:59:59|In our era of atomic clocks, it may come as a shock that sometimes Apollo 13's timebase was handled by a man saying NOW! and another man tapping their watch a couple seconds later.
088:27:37|At the moment, as they discuss, they simply can't do much to adjust the wobble in the PTC rotation. Without any active attitude reference systems and the RCS jets turned off, it is but an academic exercise.
088:55:31|The accident happened almost exactly 33 hours previously. Since then, they have not been using any of their hydrogen. Both of the hydrogen tanks are still nearly full of supercritical liquid hydrogen. The tanks are no longer being drained by the fuel cells nor are they managed by the crew. With the sector 4 hull panel missing, every time that side of the Service Module points at the Sun, the usually sheltered tanks receive the full brunt of unfiltered sunlight. It is possible that with this heating in the tanks, the pressure inside may rise high enough to crack open the relief valve, designed to do exactly that if the hydrogen pressure gets too high.
088:56:10|It is unsure what Jim suspects it could be, besides the cryogenic hydrogen. The Service Module is still full of other pressurized gasses and fluids. The SPS engine fuel and oxidizer tanks are barely touched. There is a supply of high pressure helium to pressurize the SPS fuel system, as well as high pressure nitrogen tanks that are used to actuate the SPS valves.
088:59:10|Fred Haise caught this image of Jim Lovell enjoying a bit of music at some point during their return home. Jim is holding the tape recorder in his hand. The tape recorder was a standard device made by Sony and only slightly modified for space service.
|It is almost 90 hours into the mission of Apollo 13. Some 10 hours previously, the Descent Engine on the Lunar Module <i>Aquarius</i> was fired in the PC+2 maneuver to establish a faster return trajectory back to Earth. This is planned to result in a landing at approximately 142 hours GET. The spacecraft has been powered down, and the crew is coasting towards home in an increasingly cold state. The spacecraft has recently developed a slow wobbling motion, which has been attributed to a possible venting of pressurized hydrogen from the Service Module's cryogenic tanks. Their most immediate concern is the buildup of carbon dioxide in the cabin, but methods for removing that have been read up to the crew. It will be down to them to construct a device for the purpose.
089:07:54|To make it easier to follow the upcoming procedure, an outline is provided here:
089:07:54|<b>1.</b> Taping of two canisters together, and adding tape to ease with installation of the rest of the parts needed.
089:07:54|<b>2.</b> A piece of cardboard is folded and taped onto the top to prevent collapse of the bag around the inlet of the canister.

089:08:15|For further information and a detailed walkthrough on the canister modification, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a13/a13_LIOH_Adapter.html" target="_blank">you should visit our sister publication at the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal for a thorough article:</a>
090:08:05|The canister adapter prototype was also passed around from hand to hand in Mission Control. In this photo, Deke Slayton is captured demonstrating the device to Flight Director Milton Windler (leaning to the console on the left) and NASA managers Howard Tindall (Deputy Director of flight operations at Manned Spaceflight Center), Sigurd Sjoberg, (Director of flight operations) Christopher Kraft (Deputy Director of Manned Spaceflight Center) and Dr Robert Gilruth. (Director of Manned Spaceflight Center)
090:10:03|The Command Module ECS LiOH canisters are usually inserted into their receptacles in the CM. They contain the carbon dioxide absorbing lithium hydroxide and activated charcoal, for removing odors.
090:11:22|The Flight Data File materials are in spiralbound form.
090:22:42|The topic of Jack's tax report has been a recurring joke among the Mission Control personnel.
090:27:37|The idea here is to provide something for their further taping to stick onto by creating belts of sticky surface by using the tape. During the prototype phase in Houston, it was discovered that the Teflon coating on the canisters made it impervious to duct tape!
090:30:35|The canisters were located to different parts of the LM cockpit to provide air flow into the entire cabin. They were strapped into place.
090:59:04|Oxygen into the space suits is supplied via the "blue" hose - identified by the color of the connector - while spent air from the suit flows back along the "red" hose. The twin plastic hoses are usually wrapped in a protective Beta cloth to shield them against abrasion and kinking. Now they must split the hoses apart so that they can put the ends of the different colored hoses to different parts of the cabin. This is easier said than done due to their general lack of cutting implements onboard. What they had were their personal scissors, officially reserved for cutting open the food packages. It makes sense for the mission planners to avoid stocking the spacecraft with items capable of puncturing, cutting or abrading.
091:12:30|A state of uncertainly currently exists to the exact condition of the Command Module Odyssey. This also extends to the configuration of the hundreds of switches and other controllers in the Master Display Console and other panels inside the CM. The Mission Control's goal is to have every control set to a state known to them in Houston, so that they can base their future procedures on a known initial state of affairs inside the once-evacuated Command Module.
091:14:00|Jack has instantly guessed that the baseline configuration plan involves the Launch Checklist, which they carry onboard. It was used just before and after their launch, and contained the procedures for the Translunar Injection, for example. It also contains emergency procedures in case of launch aborts.
091:14:00|Jack's speed of thinking here should not come as a surprise. He was one of the astronauts assigned to the development of the Command Module and the various crew procedures needed to operate it. If anyone onboard Apollo 13 could be described as an expert on the Command Module, that would undoubtedly be Jack Swigert.
091:21:11|The Apollo 13 crew has a surprise guest on the comm loop in the form of Thomas Stafford, the veteran astronaut of Gemini 6A, Gemini 9A and Apollo 10. At the moment he is the Chief of the Astronaut Office. He took over the post from Alan Shepard, who had managed to get his inner ear problems in check with surgery and was now training for Apollo 14.
091:21:11|Stafford makes a reference to the CPCB or Crew Procedures Control Board. This organization was responsible for validating all procedures and the associated documentation the crew might need to operate their spacecraft and perform their mission successfully. Normally such procedures would be frozen several months before each mission, although changes could - and would - be made up until the launch, on special basis.
091:49:30|The Launch Checklist is stowed in compartment R-3 in the Command Module.
091:53:15|14 pages in the Command Module Launch Checklist note all of the 417 switches, selectors, buttons, levers and knobs that need to be configured for the spacecraft launch. It is customary for the backup crew of each mission to do this preparatory work, alongside the ground crews. For this so-called baseline configuration, modifications have been made to this list as applicable to their unprecedented situation. Each page can be accessed below from the associated links whenever the radio loop exchange reaches that part of the very long checklist.
091:53:41|As per the list, they start with the Entry Monitoring System.
091:54:15|This sets up the IMU as the attitude reference being used for the computer, and selects the BMAGs as the attitude reference for the FDAI 8-ball.
091:54:36|Jack appears to get bored with Joe's initial idea on going through the checklist, and suggests a new procedure they will use from now on.
091:54:54|The RATE COMMAND mode is actually not wired, and simply sets the system on standby on each axis here.
091:55:15|They switch the hand controllers off to ensure no accidental maneuvering.
091:57:39|Rest of the switches concern the SPS engine and the Command Module RCS thrusters, and everything is configured to OFF.
091:58:39|The now inert SM RCS is configured to OFF position as well.
091:59:54|The talkbacks are springloaded, but turning the switches will actuate the mechanical switches inside.
092:00:19|EDS AUTO refers to the Emergency Detection System, which would operate during the launch and automatically scan for mission-ending failures in the Saturn V launch vehicle. In AUTO mode, it is allowed to issue an abort to rescue the crew faster than they could react to such emergencies themselves.
092:00:34|They continue to set switches that would be important for launch to the OFF position, since they are now superfluous.
092:00:58|The configuration keeps all the SPS-related components offline.
092:03:27|The Launch Escape Tower systems are obviously also superfluous, and need to be set to OFF.
092:03:42|The Mission Timer remains OFF for the moment. The next item to be configured is the Caution and Warning System. The Launch Checklist suggests setting the C/W to BOOST mode which disables the red MASTER ALARM light. This is to prevent the crew, rattled by the G forces and the rocket launch, from mistaking the alarm light to an ABORT light. They set it to ACK mode, which turns off the systems status lights on the top of the console. They also configure the system for detecting issues only in the Command Module, considering the Service Module is not functioning. In the end they switch power to OFF.
092:04:21|Unsurprisingly, they agree that powering the cryo tank systems is not necessary.
092:04:29|The rest of the page is concerns the cooling systems, and remains configured as given in the list.
092:07:34|There are a large number of changes on this page, mostly because it contains the fuel cell configuration. They are all set to OFF, since they no longer have any functioning ones.
092:09:06|The VHF radio is once again kept offline.
092:09:22|They turn the noise suppression in the radio off, and secure the fuel cell reactant valve switches.
092:09:46|This configures the onboard tape recorder to off, and powers off the telemetry system until they want to turn it on.
092:10:34|These switches would usually be configured to supply the Command Module systems with power during the launch, but now everything is turned off, considering they will start from an unpowered spacecraft.
092:10:35|Further communications-related power switches are turned off.
092:12:58|Again, all the power cell-related systems are left unpowered.
092:13:28|They want to make sure that the interior lights are turned off before they start powering up.
092:14:08|Panel 5 is the right-hand side panel, which would be Fred's station, and has the circuit breakers for many systems, such as the ECS and guidance systems.
092:14:27|Panel 7 is on the left-hand side, at Commander's station. They turn off power to the Emergency Detection System and the FDAI 8-ball.
092:16:21|Panel 8 is the large circuit breaker and switch panel on the left-hand side.
092:17:53|SEQ ARM refers to the Sequential systems, which usually are the systems with automated elements, such as the abort systems and the parachute deployment.
092:20:43|They ensure that power to all the Service Module's 16 RCS jets is turned off.
092:23:32|These switches control further communications gear inside the cabin.
092:23:57|Panel 100 has the power switches for the IMU - usually never turned off during flight, but now they will have the interesting task of trying to get it back online.
092:24:26|Panel 101 has the Systems Test Meter as well as the switches for the onboard dump systems.
092:24:41|Panel 122 has the controls for the CM optics.
092:24:53|Panels 162 and 163 are utility power sockets. Panel 201 has the power switch for the electric food warmer.
092:25:14|Panel 225 has circuit breakers that govern power to the Command Module communications systems.
092:28:00|Panel 226 has the circuit breakers that govern power to the fuel cell, cryo tank and onboard lighting systems. Are all left unpowered.
092:28:51|They leave the lighting circuits closed.
092:31:49|Panel 227 is another utility socket. Panel 229 has breakers for various systems, including some system monitoring instrumentation and onboard timing equipment.
092:32:29|Circuit breakers on panel 250 control various configurations of battery power that can be applied to the systems needed for making a safe landing as well as battery ties in case one of the batteries fails.
092:33:10|These two breakers supply power from the pyro batteries to the sequential systems that operate the pyrotechnic devices - including those that deploy the parachutes during landing.
092:34:12|Panel 251 is the overboard dump control. The Waste Stowage Vent is used to bleed out air from the storage compartment meant for the crew's feces, which would be carried back to Earth for scientific analysis. This anti-odor measure would also have the secondary effect of helping the cabin air bleed out during their ascent to space in their launch - a necessity so that the onboard oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere is flushed out and replaced by their 100% oxygen flight atmosphere.
092:34:26|Panel 275's breakers are important, governing entire main buses as well as the AC inventers.
092:34:41|They leave the instrumentation power breakers on panel 276 closed, and open all on 278, which would be only needed for landing.
092:35:00|Panel 306 is the Lower Equipment Bay mission timer.
092:37:17|This configuration leaves all their oxygen sources and the cooling system shut off for now.
092:38:49|Further controls for the cooling system are set to the 'OFF' position.
092:38:49|Page 14 only concerns the CM side hatch, and they do not watch to touch that!
092:45:00|Frank Borman was Jim's Commander during their historical lunar orbital flight in December 1968. The three-man crew suffered from sleep deprivation due to the attempt to keep one man at watch at all times while the others tried to sleep in the cabin. Frank Borman also fell ill during the flight and would have been particularly tired and prone to being disturbed by any crew activity while trying to catch his sleep.
092:45:06|Deke drops by to joke with the crew here.
092:48:48|The ASA is the Abort Sensor Assembly and contains their attitude and acceleration sensing equipment. With no heaters on, they might be losing their accuracy over time.
092:50:58|The window shades can be used to block light in the Command Module. This could be done for various reasons, ranging from reducing glare on their instrument displays to controlling sunlight for photography, or to help with dark acclimation for a crewman intending to use the navigational optics. However, they have now discovered that covering the windows has prevented the sunlight's heating effect as well and as a result the Command Module has become even colder than before.
092:51:26|A bizarre contraption is carried in the Command Module, and meant for the crew to share so as to perform some exercise using the rubber bands in it for resistance in zero G.
092:59:36|They were told not to dump any water or urine overboard early on in the emergency, and have stuck to the rule. As a result, the LM cabin is starting to get filled up with urine bags.
093:00:03|It is about quarter past 10 in the morning in Houston, on the 15th of April, 1970.
093:00:34|Fred plans to use a water tank in the LM to store their human wastes instead, but is worried about potential leakage. Nobody wants that, especially since the urine system was prone to leaving such droplets floating around even on normal operation, if they were not careful.
093:26:42|The ECS light comes up in a variety of situations, including when the carbon dioxide level gets too high. They have been using the LM secondary filter for several hours and suspect it is nearing its end.
093:28:37|The ECS loop has a water separator, used to remove excess moisture generated by the crew in their exhalations. By limiting the airflow into their newly jury-rigged life support system, they will try to prevent the separator from causing trouble due to the altered air flow characteristics in the originally carefully balanced system.
093:58:03|In-flight photo shows the suit hoses extending from inside the LM cabin and into the docking tunnel to ventilate the Command Module using the new LiOH canister rig.
093:58:26|This closes the suit circuit, and hence the atmosphere will flow through the suit circuit, rather than into the cabin. They want to do this so that all the air will go through their new canister filter.
093:58:33|The CABIN GAS RETURN valve controls whether the cabin air is allowed to flow into the ECS system. They select EGRESS to close the circuit, so that the onboard air will flow through the hose plugged into the canister.
093:59:52|SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF valve allows the suit circuit to release gas into the atmosphere if the pressure rises too high. They set this to CLOSE position now, to maintain circuit integrity.
094:00:01|The ECS panel on the back of the LM cabin has the controls they are using now to configure the cabin air flow as they need it to be, for their new filtering system to work.
094:00:13|With the secondary canister removed, this selection allows the suit circuit air to flow int othe empty canister compartment, but first it will go through the suit hose and the CM lithium hydroxide canister hooked up to it, to scrub the atmosphere.
094:00:16|This diagram from the Apollo 13 Investigation Board report shows the LiOH rig installation. It draws cabin air through the canister using the suction from the suit fans. As the air passes through the canister, the CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed by the lithium hydroxide. Newly cleaned atmosphere flows through the empty LM LiOH installation and then through the fans and the water separator. From here the air exists through the open suit hoses, blowing into the Command Module to replenish their atmosphere as well.
|Almost five days into the mission, the crew of the stricken Apollo 13 has been relatively busy for the past 15 hours or so. They have performed the PC+2 burn to cut 10 hours off their return time, powered down the LM, fashioned an adapter for the carbon dioxide scrubbers and received instructions on how to configure the Command Module <i>Odyssey</i> into a state from which a startup may be enacted once the time comes for reentry into Earth's atmosphere. For now, the crew is simply hanging on, saving water and electricity and hoping that nothing else will fail onboard their spacecraft.
|This onboard film capture shows Jack Swigert at the Commander's station in the <i>Aquarius</i>. Above him is the docking window. The somewhat messy-looking white arrangement behind him towards the back of the cabin is the LM storage shelf.
094:01:45|Mission Control's plan is to get some battery power onto the Command Module DC buses. This is done to make sure that everything is powered down, and will not disturb the system once they begin to power up again. Another concern are the motor switches, which are remote electric switches controlled with circuit breakers and on/off switches on the Main Display Console. There is some concern that the mechanical switches might be freezing due to the dropping temperatures.
094:01:45|Battery power is stored in three entry and post-landing batteries in the Command Module. There are two Battery Buses, and each can be powered by connecting the batteries into them. The worrisome motor switches are used to connect the Battery Buses into the Main DC Buses.
094:03:24|They do not need the transponder nor the data transmitter unit powered, hence the circuit breakers are pulled.
094:03:24|A complete checklist of the procedure read up to the crew now is found in the Flight Operations Report and reproduced below:
094:04:15|These circuit breakers apply power to the Battery Buses A and B, allowing their voltages to be checked from the displays on the MDC, as well as enables the battery charger to charge these batteries, when used.
094:04:52|These circuit breakers enable the voltage on on the Main Buses to be displayed on the onboard instrumentation as well as the telemetry.
094:05:35|These circuit breakers connect Battery A and Battery B to their respective battery buses. These will be required to get the battery power into the Main Buses later.
094:06:09|The next step is for Jack to use the rotating switch on Panel 3 to select the two Battery Buses, A and B, for readout on the voltage gauge.
094:06:44|The two breakers closed in this step apply Battery Bus power to the DC Main Buses A and B, through the 80 amp breakers.
094:07:29|This step begins the primary part of the whole procedure, which is to ensure that the battery bus tie motor switches are functioning. By using the Main Bus Tie switch on the console, they operate the motor switch that connects the Battery Bus to the Main Bus. Afterwards, Jack will check the voltages and the battery amperes from the Panel 3 displays he used earlier to check the Battery Bus voltage.
094:08:49|This step is similar to the previous one, but this time they are connecting Battery Bus B to the DC Main Bus B and checking that the motor switch works on that part of the power distribution system as well.
094:08:55|The last step leaves the motor switches engaged, in the hopes of preventing any future troubles with them should the low temperature cause them to get stuck in either open or closed position. They can use the circuit breakers to continue to provide protection to the EPS and to serve as the ON/OFF switches for the time.
094:11:53|Jack heads up the tunnel into the Command Module. In its unpowered stage, it was mostly dark, with the sunlight coming through the windows providing illumination only when the positioning was right to do so. The picture shows the sizeable docking hatch to the left and the shiny shape of the docking probe to the right, stowed in the Command Module to be out of the way of the crew in the LM.
094:13:07|They want to see if the biomedical system can be used to transmit medical telemetry without interfering with the voice comms.
094:14:46|Fred sounds pleased that the signal conditioner on his biomedical harness is warming up once they switched it on.
094:21:10|The procedure has proven that all the DC systems have a proper voltage on them. Zero amps means that there is presently no current flowing through the system - nothing is drawing electric power from the batteries, hence the amperage is zero.
094:33:31|The cartridge adapter was first tested inside an environmental chamber that was filled with 100% oxygen atmosphere and then loaded with carbon dioxide to simulate the crew's output.
094:37:05|Mission Control is concerned that the primary water tank located in the Descent Stage could be dropping in temperature, potentially posing a risk of freezing while the spacecraft cools down. Losing the descent stage water would force them to rely on the much smaller supply in the Ascent Stage and potentially run out of cooling water. The water tank does not have a temperature sensor, hence the crew and Mission Control will check the propellant tank temperatures to get an idea on the state of the Descent Stage.
094:38:44|The tank temperature procedure simply involves powering the display and then reading the details up from the displays on the LM console. 66.5&deg;F is 19.1&deg;C.
094:39:54|The fuel temperature is 20&deg;C, the oxidizer temperature 18.3&deg;C.
094:40:19|This in-mission photograph shows the displays powered off. Several warning lights are illuminated on the top of the console. Notice the sticky tape around the 8-ball indicator - they worked as quick references to help the crew figure out how to fly the awkward machine that was the docked CSM-LM.
094:50:17|The microphone has caught a brief snippet of the LM's namesake song being played onboard.
094:55:10|That translates to 74,000 kilometers away from the Moon.
094:56:01|Their makeshift adapter arrangement is altering the flow of air in the LM's ECS system and hence the sensors that monitor the state of the life support system are apparently giving some odd readings every now and then. Their other theory is evidently that the crew might be fiddling with the controls, or accidentally bump at them while moving inside the spacecraft.
094:58:42|It appears that Fred and Jack are gossiping about the upcoming manual burn without the intention of having Mission Control listen in.
095:00:49|Fred’s first mission assignment was as Backup Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 8 with Backup Commander Neil Armstrong and Backup Command Module Pilot Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin. They trained extensively for the mission that was eventually performed by the prime crew. Fred was brought in due to the original Prime Crew member Michael Collins developing health problems, which prompted former backup CMP Jim Lovell to be reassigned to the Prime crew. Armstrong, Aldrin and a recovered Collins would form the Apollo 11 crew while Fred was assigned to Apollo 13’s crew with Lovell and Ken Mattingly. Lovell and Haise were backup crewmembers for Apollo 11, along with Lovell's Apollo 8 LMP Bill Anders. Incidentally, Ken Mattingly supported Apollo 8 as a CapCom in Mission Control.
095:00:49|The gist of the conversation between the two men appears to be Fred assuring Jack that the Command Module is capable of making a safe reentry even without many of the more advanced systems and methods usually at their disposal.
095:11:52|The clock is ticking on the supercritical helium tank that gave the crew worries during the early part of the mission. Mission Control has calculated the time when it will reach critical pressure for the tank to start venting via a component known as the burst disk. The "blowdown capacity" mentioned is the ability to fire the DPS engine solely using the helium pressure already in the system, without having the pressurization gas replenished from the tank. This means that the loss of the SHe tank will not mean writing off the engine completely.
095:13:15|Joe will now give Jack instructions on how to transfer LM battery power into the Command Module by reversing the current in the LM umbilicals normally used to power the LM's heaters during the translunar coast with power from the Command Module's fuel cells. Although not originally meant for this purpose, the design of the system in both spacecraft was such that it allows for power to flow the other way around as well, from the LM batteries over to the Command Module's Main Bus B. Such a power transfer has been at the core of LM lifeboat thinking, with the idea that the LM can supply Command Module's crucial navigation systems with power. Although this is not the case now, some official written procedures for this have been around at least since Apollo 11, with procedures found from the Operations Handbook for the spacecraft. This is the first practical implementation of such a procedure, however.
095:13:42|This closes the circuit breakers that supplies power to the Ascent Stage Electrical Control Assemblies, or ECAs. They are currently using the Descent Stage batteries and hence all the Ascent Stage power systems are switched off.
095:14:11|These breakers supply power to contactors that switch the batteries on and off the ECA power feeds.
095:14:41|This gets the Ascent Stage batteries to normal power feeds. Unlike the Descent module's batteries, the Ascent stage batteries do not have the "low voltage tap" mode for their early operations, but are expected to be used at high voltage from the beginning. They do, however, have the backup feed mode that will allow one battery to take over from the other, should one of the two Ascent batteries fail.
095:15:05|This step resets the batteries 1 and 3 in the Descent Stage and takes them off the power bus.
095:15:50|This resets the rest of the Descent Stage batteries.
095:16:13|Two cables - for redundancy - runs from the Command Module to the Lunar Module in the docking tunnel between the spacecraft. Normally it is plugged in as soon as the two spacecraft dock during Transpostion and Docking, to supply the LM with power to its heaters. Now they are taking the first steps to reverse that connection, to transfer power from the LM into the CM instead.
095:16:43|These circuit breakers in the Command Module supply CM power into the LM umbilical from Command Module's Main Bus B.
095:17:11|This breaker governs power into the sensor that produces electrical system info to the onboard displays and the telemetry.
095:17:40|This breaker connects Battery B in the Command Module into the battery bus.
095:18:14|The switch activates the power connection between the two spacecraft.
095:19:15|Joe forgot to give the instructions in the right order. Battery B has to be enabled in the Battery Bus as well.
095:19:53|Either circuit breaker will then cut the battery B power into the system.
095:20:37|This turns off the Battery B, and then they can check the voltage on the display to see if they are getting power from the LM into the Main Bus. Having pulled the CM battery off, this should now be their source of power.
095:21:12|This is a step they performed all the way back when starting up the LM and connect the Descent Stage batteries to high voltage taps.
095:21:47|This turns off the Ascent Stage batteries.
095:21:51|The power umbilical is not designed to supply a great deal of power, hence only a current of 15 amp can be normally tolerated. It is still a considerable amount of power - about 400 watts - and will make all the difference very soon in the future.
095:23:56|Fred is pleased to hear that his crew comrade is working for them on Earth.
095:24:11|Fred is naturally only joking. They would not be able to spare the oxygen lost by depressurizing the cabin. They are also not equipped for a deep space EVA, let alone trained for it. Routine EVA capacity was only added for Apollo 15 and subsequent missions for the purpose of servicing the SIM Bay in the Service Module.
095:27:39|Fred suggests that they could load their urine into the PLSS and then pump the said waste water into the LM's water system via the Ascent Stage water tank. Joe Kerwin is not too enthusiastic, considering that Mission Control studies have revealed that to try the water transfer, they need an empty Ascent Stage water tank. They want to save the Ascent stage supplies as long as possible and use up the Descent Stage water first.
095:27:39|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;In fact, while we were talking about the water, and talking about feeding PLSS water into the sublimator, I had a way figured out to get the urine through the sublimator.&quot;
095:27:39|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Of course, at this time, we were also thinking about the PLSSs, about using the water for the sublimator and then using the fans and the batteries and the oxygen in case the LM system failed.&quot;
095:27:39|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;It's really surprising that a lot of the things the ground sent up, we had discussed.&quot;
|The fifth day of the mission of Apollo 13 begins with a relatively quiet time for the crew. Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert received instructions on how to connect the LM batteries into the Command Module's power systems. Their stringent conservation of resources continues as they coast towards an upcoming midcourse correction to ensure that they will land where they want to. The observation of something apparently leaking from the inert Service Module has the crew and Mission Control puzzled.
096:21:03|It's around half past 1 in the afternoon on the 15th of April, 1970, in Houston.
096:21:39|The spacecraft's trajectory between the Earth and the Moon is a gravitational tug of war, determined by basic laws of physics. Both the Earth and the Moon have their own gravitational field, with its size proportionate to the mass of the object. With the Earth's much larger mass, its gravitional influence is hence larger. However, while close to the Moon, the moon's relatively smaller gravitational influence is still the dominant one, considering that gravitational attraction decreases rapidly with distance. Close to the Moon, the Moon's pull slows down the spacecraft that is moving away from the Moon. However, since they have escape velocity, at one point they reach the point between the Earth and the Moon where they first counter each other's gravitional pull. Since the spacecraft has enough energy to escape Moon's gravity, it enters the Earth's dominant sphere and hence will start to pick up speed, with the Earth pulling the spacecraft towards itself. From now on, they are falling towards the surface of the Earth, slowly at first, then with ever-increasing velocity.
096:22:39|Currently neither spacecraft has any proper attitude reference, beyond looking out of the windows. If they want to use the Command Module Computer to guide their re-entry into Earth atmosphere, they have to figure out how to produce a useful alignment in the Command Module's inertial platform. While star sightings are usually the way to go, the visibility has been very poor since the accident due to the debris causing reflections that appear as false stars.
096:22:39|Very long comm break
096:37:47|Very long comm break
097:15:02|A strange noise and an apparent leak from the descent stage has alarmed the crew. Their first instinct is to inquire on the status of the supercritical helium tank, which is expected to vent sometime in the future. According to the math, it should be several hours away still.
097:16:12|The start tank is a gaseous helium tank used to pre-pressurize the fuel system before the supercritical Helium system is connected into the fuel tanks.
097:16:30|Unknown to both to Mission Control and the crew onboard Apollo 13, a potentially hazardous situation has developed in the LM's Descent Stage battery system.
097:16:30|The LM has four primary batteries in the Descent stage. Each of these 135-pound silver-zinc batteries can provide 400 ampere hours. Two Electric Control Assembies (ECA) are used to manage the batteries in the Descent Stage.
097:16:30|Telemetry data, updated once a second, shows the voltage dropping while amperage in the batteries rocketed. Battery 2 was off the scale. This is indicative of a short circuit in battery 2.
097:16:30|It is assumed by post-mission analysis that some of the potassium hydroxide electrolyte leaked out of the battery cells and into space between the cell and the battery casing. The fluid gathered inside the battery case and caused a bridge between the battery terminal and the case to form. The electric current dissociated the electrolyte and formed free oxygen and hydrogen gas which then ignited with explosive results. The pressure buildup inside the battery casing ruptured it and resulted in free electrolyte venting out of the spacecraft which was perceived as 'snowflakes' by the crew. The battery design was amended after Apollo 13 to improve its safety and prevent such an event from happening again.
097:17:20|Mission Control has calculated their water consumption based on a presumption of the crew drinking normal amounts of water. Unknown to then, they have self-imposed rationing.
097:17:20|The controllers think that the untapped hydrogen tanks could soon start to relieve excessive pressure from them.
097:17:20|The Command Module optics will be required for a proper alignment of their inertial platform. Using their other instruments, such as the COAS monocular on the window, are less precise. They want to know if the primary optics are still of dubious value due to the debris from the accident surrounding them.
097:21:16|Their makehift PTC rotation has deteoriated to a degree that they are now wobbling around in a way that is hampering their communications even more than usual.
097:21:57|Unknown to Mission Control, the crew has self-imposed water rationing to a degree that plenty of water still remains in the Command Module tank.
097:37:28|A set of basic hand tools in a cloth roll is stored in the Command Module. Since the Block II CM design eliminated any in-flight maintenance of the onboard systems due to issues of durability and complexity this possibility introduced, the tools are only useful for doing very rudimentary tasks such as tightening loosened bolts or screws.
097:37:34|'Dikes' is electricians' slang for wire cutters. We can speculate that it was John W. Young suggesting that they'd be useful for the task. None were carried onboard, however.
097:41:21|A switch in the comms panel allows them to select between either the Commander or the Lunar Module Pilot's biomedical data to be telemetered to Mission Control.
097:41:36|They have been using a single communications set in turns, which means that Fred will have to plug his own communication cable into the system so that the biomedical signals can be routed into the comms.
097:42:03|Baseband is another name for the backup voice they're using.
098:30:12|It's around 15:45 pm in Houston at the moment. The crew's sleeping schedule, despite a valiant attempt by Mission Control to set one up properly, has been very sporadic.
098:39:24|They're on VOX mode at the moment, and garbled discussions are coming in, with mostly Jim being heard since he is the one wearing the headset and has the microphones positioned close to his mouth as he speaks. They will still capture the occasional remark from Fred as well.
098:43:06|The timing of the burn to happen before the supercritical helium burst disk blows is not due to the fear of losing the ability to pressurize the engines, but rather that the venting helium might cause them to lose their attitude. With their RCS and guidance systems powered down, this might put them into an attitude that makes them lose communications with Earth, or cause a thermal issue.
098:48:14|The repress package contains an independent oxygen supply for the Command Module, to be used in contingency situations and for repressurzing the cabin (as the name implies) if it is depressurized for EVA. The tanks are also hooked up to a regulator that supplies O<sub>2</sub> to three oxygen masks stowed in the cabin. They were available for the crew to breathe pure oxygen in case of any atmospheric contamination while the crew was not wearing their spacesuits or were suited but not hooked into the ECS suit circuit.
098:48:14|The emergency breathing masks were only used once, officially, during the landing of The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project when the cabin was contaminated with fumes from the Command Module RCS fuel system. This led to the crew of Vance Brand, Tom Stafford and Deke Slayton suffering symptoms of poisoning. Beyond this, several astronauts, Jim Lovell and Gene Cernan included, have implied that the masks saw some unofficial use during the lunar missions, especially in regards to particularly smelly situations in the cabin.
098:54:45|Jim has removed his biomedical harness, and seems to imply that the knowledge of this is a secret he's been holding back. This was turned into a somewhat humorous gag in the Ron Howard movie, where the sudden loss of signal caused the Flight Surgeon to think their hearts stopped beating.
098:56:37|The two ASCENT ECA CONT circuit breakers supply power to contactors that govern the battery power feed into the power distribution system. They are adding this step to ensure that there will be no failure of this part of the system during the power transfer to the CM.
099:50:26|Battery 2 experienced a short circuit and an explosive overpressure event earlier on around 97 hours, 15 minutes GET. It is likely that the resulting amp spike caused damage to the malfunction detection circuit, which will now continue to give spurious readings of trouble with the battery 2, despite the telemetry showing no apparent malfunction state in the battery.
099:52:01|The aforementioned breaker connects the two main buses in the LM for the purpose of sharing power loads between them.
099:58:12|It will take some time for Mission Control to come up with an idea on the battery issue, which they determine to be a malfunction in the malfunction warning circuit.
100:00:38|Charlie Duke's previous experience on the CapCom seat includes serving in that role during the harrowing 8 minutes of Powered Descent for Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin onboard the <i>Eagle</i>. Incidentally, he was joined on the CapCom station by the backup crewmembers Jim Lovell and Fred Haise, who all had the best seats to the excitement of the first lunar landing.
100:01:12|They're going to the backup procedures again, this time for the upcoming manual burn. The pages will be reproduced throughout this section, in original form and also with the changes read up to them marked.
100:01:12|Top part of the page is eliminated, since it involves turning on the main LM systems, and they're already online.
100:02:57|The power and cooling systems are online, requiring no further action for the upcoming burn.
100:04:27|Since they are performing the burn without computer control, most of the circuit breakers on panel 11 that are closed for a PGNS-guided burn are left open.
100:09:34|As on the previous page, systems required for a computer-guided burn are left unpowered.
100:12:42|Most of this page gets eliminated, considering it is instructions on turning on the LM computer and setting up the Digital Autopilot. The VHF radio is left offline, too.
100:14:32|Computer-performed operations and the RCS startup are removed from this page. A new procedure for setting up guidance using the AGS is read up to the crew and written down.
100:17:45|To reverse the PTC, they will turn on the RCS thruster heaters for 15 minutes, and then use the hand controllers in the LM to stabilize their attitude, with their windows facing the Earth. This will put them close to the desired burn attitude.
100:18:46|The Abort Sensor Assembly has been powered down and would be cold. They want to warm it up before starting the system, in the hopes of getting accurate data. Like the IMU, the gyroscopes in the ASA are only accurate within a certain temperature range.
100:21:20|Descent Propulsion System pressurization and landing gear extension procedures get the ax here. A new procedure is read up on how to assume the correct attitude for the burn using a combination of AGS MODE CONTROL and the hand controllers.
100:22:47|This burn is performed without the pressurization system on hence they will not turn on the Descent Helium Regulator 1 that would supply the supercritical Helium into the DPS.
100:23:24|Once the AGS is operating, they start programming the backup computer by entering <b>CLR 400 +50000 ENTER</b> onto the DEDA. This is the so-called body axis alignment, and sets up the AGS' attitude reference to correspond to the XYZ axes of the Lunar Module.
100:23:24|Next, they enter <b>CLR 400 +40000 ENTER</b>. This sets the DEDA into attitude hold mode, where it will attempt to maintain their present attitude, should they drift away from it. They select their yaw axis for MODE CONTROL, meaning that the AGS will control their rotation around their X axis. Their pitch and roll axes will be under crew control with the TTCA hand controller.
100:25:11|But turning the Attitude Controller Assembly handle, Jim will send a signal to AGS where it will detect their present attitude as per the ASA data, and then establish that as the new desired attitude for the AGS to maintain. This way, they will remain in their burn attitude.
100:25:52|Once they have aligned themselves to the burn attitude - which will be determined with the COAS sightings out of their front window, with their Y axis aligned on the Earth terminator -
100:25:58|Again, PGNS-related instructions are deleted.
100:28:42|It was even reported in the post-burn briefing that Jack being in the LM instead of the CM for the burn caused the LM engine to have to swivel more to maintain a proper burn attitude!
100:28:42|They remove all the PGNS-related actions here, and add some for configuring the AGS properly for the burn.
100:28:50|Doing the <b>CLR 400 +500000</b> for body axis alignment and <b>CLR 400 +000000</b> will set up the AGS to maintain their attitude again.
100:31:23|Once at the burn attitude and with the AGS attitude reference and attitude hold set, they don't want to give the computer any new signals at this point. Simply moving the ACA hand controller would send a signal to the AGS which resets the attitude hold.
100:31:23|The four AGS inputs are used to set up the AGS for monitoring the changes in velocity from the burn. - <b>404, 406 and 406</b> detect changes in acceleration along the three body axes. <b>470</b> will display acceleration on the X axis - or the direction of the engine, hence it will be put on the DEDA to be displayed, and to act as a reference to how much delta-V has been gained.
100:31:23|The timeline of events running up to the burn are tweaked somewhat, to accompany their manual operations.
100:34:30|On the final page, they change the burn guidelines to be based on burntime, rather than fuel quantity left. A long procedure for setting up the PTC rotation manually is read up and written down.
100:36:10|They will use the <b>470</b> displayed on the DEDA to monitor the gained DELTA-V.
100:37:30|Just like the BMAGs and the Gyro Display Coupler (GDC) provide a backup attitude reference for the Command Module, the gyroscopes in the AGS' Abort Sensor Assembly perform that function for the Lunar Module.
100:38:20|The plan is to shut off the DPS engine promptly, and correct their velocity with a few puffs from the RCS jets. They'll rather take slightly less velocity gained from the burn, to be trimmed with the RCS rather than an overburn which would require them slowing down using the RCS. Firing the upwards-pointing jets to do so for any length of time could cause damage to the thermal shielding covering the skin of the Command Module.
100:47:54|By blowdown, Charlie Duke means that the Descent Propulsion System engine will be fired without the supercritical helium pressurization system active. They are using the pre-existing pressure in the system, which is sufficient for firing the engine for a limited amount of time and at limited power - such as this burn in question.
|Strange noises in the Descent Stage and battery alarms have been the woe of the crew of Apollo 13 for the past few hours. Now over 100 hours into their mission, another 40 hours in space remain until they are to splash down onto the Pacific Ocean. They have also been provided with instructions on how to perform a mostly manually controlled course correction burn using the AGS backup guidance system and visual references by looking out of the LM window. Plans also exist for charging the somewhat depleted CM reentry batteries from LM power using the cables that would normally supply power from the CM into the LM. Their stores of power, oxygen and water are still a GO, but subject to careful rationing. Another worry is the constantly dropping temperature, not only uncomfortable to the crew, but a potential threat to their equipment.
101:07:44|Jack has been mostly unoccupied since the accident, considering he has no expertise in the LM systems or its operation. His workload is about to increase considerably now that the return to the Command Module approaches.
101:07:55|The original procedure is provided from the links below as available. What they want to do is to switch on the Command Module batteries and power up some of the onboard system to see how they have survived since the Command Module was powered down after the accident. This will give everyone involved information on what kind of procedures might be needed for their reentry if there is evidence of the systems degrading from the cold temperature.
101:07:55|The LMP's side of the cabin has several circuit breaker panels that Jack is now about to use to get power from the batteries and into the systems onboard the dormant <i>Odyssey</i>. You can view a version with the panels annotated for clarity <a href="photos/cbpanelsANNO.png" target="_blank">from this link.</a>
101:08:45|Jack's first step is to work the LMP's side console in the Command Module and close circuit breakers that supply power into the various sensors in the main systems that they want to check out here. They will also prepare the inverters for producing the AC power the telemetry sensors require.
101:14:16|The next step starts up the Command Module's communication system and configures it to produce a high power signal for the purpose of transmitting telemetry to Mission Control. They will use the Omni D antenna for this.
101:14:37|Next they close circuit breakers that provide power to the aforementioned communications equipment, as well as the CTE - Central Timing Equipment. The CTE provides timing reference used by many of the onboard systems to synchronize them. While the Command Module Computer usually provides the basic timing reference, the CTE has its own crystal-based oscillator - not unlike a quartz clock - to provide this function when the computer is not available. This separate panel is under the Main Display Console.
101:15:37|Panel 250 connects the Command Module batteries to the power distribution system. Now they're connecting Battery C in.
101:18:08|These switches are used to connect the battery to Main Bus B, and power the inverter 2 from Main Bus B as well.
101:20:48|After pushing in the breaker on Panel 250 to connect Battery B into the system. Next they will power the AC inventer number 2 from Main Bus B, and connect inventer 2 to AC Bus 1 to provide AC power for the telemetry sensors.
101:35:55|Jack appeared to assume at first that he will perform the procedure with power being transferred from the LM. A procedure for that was read up earlier to him. This is not the case for now, with the plan to only use internal battery power in the CM for the purpose.
101:36:17|The comms configuration they plan to use only involves the telemetry system to transmit data to Mission Control, no voice radio.
101:38:47|They configure the LM comms mostly to the low power mode they've been using throughout the emergency phase of the mission.
101:40:37|Jim is wondering on how to stabilize the ship per the earlier instructions. The visual reference available to him for the procedure is the 8-ball, and it doesn't have the same precision as the computer DSKY would have.
101:42:24|The orders are to basically just wait and see, which Jim isn't perfectly happy with.
101:53:47|Jack is unable to verify the Main Bus B voltage from the onboard display, and they go on checking their configuration to make sure that they have actually enabled it.
101:56:28|They finally are receiving the much wanted data from the Command Module.
102:01:54|Now back in Earth's sphere of influence, the PAO announcements are made in relation to the distance from Earth. Right now it stands at 296,933 km and their velocity is picking up at 1,309 m/s.
102:09:01|The values Jack reads out can be interpreted as below. The RCS temperatures and the battery manifold pressure are read out from the Systems Test Meter.
102:09:01|Battery C voltage -37 volts - normal.
102:09:01|Pyro battery A and B - 37 volts - normal
102:09:01|SPS helium pressure - 3,450 psi - this is the helium used to pressurize the SPS tanks, and is normal.
102:09:01|Nitrogen A - 2,300 / Nitrogen B - 2,400 psia - high-pressure nitrogen gas is used to operate valves in the SPS engine. This pressure is normal as well.
102:09:01|Command Module RCS injector temperatures - these range from +30 &deg; F to + 42 &deg; F - or -1.1 &deg; C to + 5.6 &deg; C. They are cold, but have internal heaters that can be used to warm them up before use, hence this is not a critical issue.
102:09:01|Battery manifold pressure - 5.60 psia - pressure in the line that is used to vent the batteries if they produce gas - like the LM batteries have done during the mission.
102:10:30|The majority of the readings are drawn from the telemetry, of course, rather than the onboard displays.
102:10:59|The crew's basic onboard clothing consists of the Constant Wear Garment - a cotton full body underwear, as well as the flight coveralls made of Teflon fabric. Neither provides a lot of comfort against the cold temperatures being experienced onboard the two spacecraft at the moment.
102:10:59|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I don't know how to discuss the clothing and related equipment. Obviously, the inflight coveralls we had weren't adequate for the conditions we had. The coveralls are great for a nominal mission. I hate to imply that we should carry liners or something like that with us. I sure think we can improve the footwear,though. I know that Grumman, down at the Cape, has for their checkout people a soft boot that is worn in the LM. An insulated soft boot would have been much more adequate than what we had.&quot;
102:10:59|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;With the addition of probably just one set of Nomex thermals, we'd have been in good shape. We needed a set of thermal underwear on.&quot;
102:10:59|<b>Slayton, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;What did you end up wearing?&quot;
102:10:59|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Constant wear garments.&quot;
102:10:59|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Two constant wear garments.&quot;
102:27:16|Battery 2 has rallied, despite the earlier issues with it. The exact cause of the problems is still unknown both to the crew and Mission Control.
102:57:19|This PAD was for the situation that radio contact was lost and the crew would have to perform the burn solo without ground assistance - which is the essence of a PAD, anyway.
103:01:18|This tantalizing conversation suggests that something was hidden in the LM food locker that the crew has discovered. It is not elaborated on, however. It is possible that the hidden item in question was a number of gifts from Marilyn Lovell and Fred Haise to their moonlanding husbands. It is known that something of the sort was found onboard, but we're not exactly sure what.
103:04:45|The Service Module RCS quads have a minimum operational temperature rated at 55&deg;F. (12.8&deg;C)Since they will not be used, the low temperature in at least one of the quads is not an issue. The range of temperatures is more indicative of the state of their passive thermal control, and is determined by how much direct sunlight each part of the Service Module might be receiving at the time.
103:04:45|The Command Module RCS engine fuel injectors have a mininum operational temperature rated at 28&deg;F. (-2.2 &deg;C) This only applies to a dormant system, however, and by activating the RCS heaters later on they will be able to bring them up to a more comfortable operational temperature.
103:04:45|The Command Module has its own RCS jets for attitude control after SM separation. They are embedded in the structure of the ship and consist of a simple design of a fuel and oxidizer injector as well as a burn chamber with an ablative lining to prevent it from melting. The jets are helium-pressurized and use the same hypergolic propellants as the SPS engine and the SM RCS.
103:04:45|The Apollo heatshield is constructed of a stainless steel plate onto which a fibreglass honeycomb is bonded. Eeach of the 370,000 cells in the lattice are filled with the Avco ablative resin from heated caulking guns. The shield is then cured in an enormous oven to harden the material. The whole heat shield is then X-rayed to see any defects in its construction. The final product is filed and sanded to shape and thickness.
103:04:45|The ablative heat shield has four temperature sensors installed. The safe range of operational temperature has been determined to be between -150&deg;F (-101&deg;C) and + 200&deg;F. (93 &deg;C)
|The increasingly uncomfortable crew of Apollo 13 has accomplished another important task on their return home. By temporarily powering up parts of the Command Module, they have discovered that the systems needed for making their Earth landing are still in working shape. With the plan to charge the CM batteries, they hope that everything will function properly once they reach the moment of reentry. Before that, however they will have to adjust their trajectory at least once more, without the use of the guidance computer in the powered down Lunar Module <i>Aquarius</i>. The time for that course correction burn approaches.
103:43:43|Although the Earth viewed through the COAS will be the main visual reference, the crew is passed information on the AOT's use for this purpose as well. While most normal burn procedures have up to dozens of rules on when to abort, this time they are only given one - fast erratic motions on any of the three axes are their cue to stop.
103:48:00|'Trim' is adjusting the burn with the help of the RCS jets.
103:52:24|TELMU (Lunar Module Electrical, Environmental and EMU Officer) has figured a seemingly unintuitive way to try to warm up the cabin a little. The SUIT TEMP rheostat controls the temperature of the oxygen in the suit circuit by managing the flow of the coolant glycol into the regenerative heat exchanger. The coolant is warm when it enters the heat exchanger, hence able to warm up the gas flow. At COLD setting, the flow of coolant is decreased, bringing in less heat, while at HOT the high flow rate brings more heat. However, with the spacecraft powered down, the glycol is very cold as a result of the spacecraft having a low thermal load, and hence the glycol that is meant to warm the air flow is actually making it colder. By using the COLD setting, they reduce the glycol flow which should also reduce the unfortunate cooling of their oxygen flow.
103:59:02|A sudden disappearance of nearly a liter of water from the LM tank has made Mission Control suspicious that the crew has been drinking out of the LM, which they've been told not to do.
104:00:50|Distance to go, 287,265 km, velocity 1,341 m/s. They've picked up 40 m/s of velocity in the last two hours from the increasing pull of the Earth gravity.
104:32:41|They've started to warm up the RCS jet quads so that they will be safely usable during the burn for attitude control.
104:35:53|This manual maneuver PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b>Midcourse correction to improve entry corridor angle.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b>105 hours, 30 minutes GET. Issuing a Noun 33 value is arbitrary in this case since they are not using the computer to control the burn. It is simply used as a familiar term in filling the PAD. Timing will be performed manually.<br> <b>Change in velocity, fps (m/s) (Noun 81):</b> Not applicable. The change in velocity is usually resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal). However, this is burn is performed without the LGC that would perform the calculations based on the values given here. They will simply point their vehicle and fire the engine.<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> and <b>H<sub>P</sub></b> The apogee is not applicable since their trajectory is not an orbit around any spatial body but a reentry trajectory. The perigee is 19.8 miles (31.8 km), meaning that they will enter the Earth atmosphere.<br> <b>Delta-V<sub>R</sub>:</b>7.8 fps (2.38 m/s). Normally this would be the the total resultant change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above. Since this will be a manual burn, the normal calculations are not applicable.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b>15 seconds.<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b>N/NA<br> <b>Change in velocity for the AGS (Noun 86):</b>N/A <br> <b>GDA angles:</b>N/A. These would be the angles to which the nozzle of the descent engine will be aimed to place its thrust axis through the stack's estimated centre of mass. It was noted earlier that burn will be made with the engine nozzle locked into place, hence nothing is recorded here.
104:35:53|Additional notes: Ullage to settle the fuel in the tanks will be performed manually, with 4 RCS jets for 10 seconds. DPS will be manually throttled to 10 percent thrust for the duration of the burn. Engine start and stop will be manual.
104:35:53|Way to go, 285,154 km, velocity, 1,348 m/s.
104:38:38|Lunar Module maneuver PADs do not have room for Earth entry information. This has to be written down in a CSM PAD.
104:40:20|This partial entry PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Expected splashdown point (Noun 61):</b> latitude 21.67 &deg; south, longitude 165.36&deg; ; in the mid-Pacific/Primary recovery area.<br> <b>Range to go at the 0.05 g event:</b> 1,163.1 nautical miles. To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel from the 0.05 g event to landing. This figure will be decremented by the EMS based on signals from its own accelerometer.<br> <b>Expected velocity at the 0.05 g event:</b> 36,292 fps. This is another entry for the EMS. It is entered into the unit's Delta-V counter and will be decremented based on signals from its own accelerometer.<br> <b>Predicted GET of 0.05 g event:</b> 142 hours, 41 minutes, 02 seconds GET.
104:46:55|The LM RCS jets are ready for action.
104:54:52|The Abort Sensor Assembly's operational temperature is rated at +120&deg;F, or +49&deg;C
104:58:19|The Abort Guidance System, or AGS, interfaces with the Control Electronics Section in many ways, just like the PGNS main guidance system does as well. The Abort Sensor Assembly, or ASA, uses hull-strapped accelerometers and gyroscopes to provide inertial sensing data. The Abort Electronics Assembly is a computer that takes over the functions of the LGC should it fail. While more rudimentary and less capable, the AGS is able to maintain attitude control and calculate DPS, APS and RCS burns that would be needed to get the crew to a safe rendezvous with the orbiting Command Service Module. Right now they are pressing the AGS into duty to maintain partial attitude control while the crew performs the rest of the course correction under manual crew control.
104:58:19|It is interesting to note that in the Command Module the backup control system, the Stabilization Control System (SCS), was electromechanical, utilizing dedicated sensors, manual crew input, and separate electronics packages. For the LM an independent, fully fledged backup guidance and control was required due to the complex demands put on the LM by its highly specialized mission. The SCS is capable of maintaining vehicle attitude and for manually controlling the SPS engine burns, which is enough for what is required to get the crew home even without the guidance computer. The LM's mission profile is much more dynamic. Emergency return to orbit from powered descent would simply not be possible under non-computer assisted control.
105:06:03|They are 282,622 kilometers away from Earth and their velocity is 1,356.4 m/s.
105:11:01|They have managed to twist and turn the Apollo stack into position for the course correction.
105:17:01|They will not adjusting the pointing of the engine nozzle for this burn, hence they want to make sure that the system responsible for it isn't on.
105:17:58|
105:18:48|Fred is referring to address <b>470</b> in the DEDA, set up to display their acceleration from the burn.
105:19:23|To 'trim', they are firing the RCS jets to add a little more velocity using the downwards-pointing, or plus X thrusters. Such an undershoot is preferable to burning too much and needing to reduce their velocity by using the upwards-pointing RCS jets. This could burn the skin of the Command Module, if used extensively.
105:27:08|The plan to set up the Passive Thermal Control rotation consists of the crew using the hand controllers to rotate the spacecraft along the X-axis (essentially to start a spin), with the help of the AGS-driven 8-ball to show their movements to them. The number of pulses referred to here is the amount of very quick puffs of RCS fire, to impart the force required to set up the motion.
105:35:09|Remarkably, their unwieldy stack has reached a very stable attitude for the moment, and they are ready to start the PTC rotation.
105:38:59|They are reconfiguring the comms system to include the S-Band ranging being kept on, to assist with establishing their exact trajectory after the course correction burn.
105:42:17|These somewhat disjointed comments are one side of a conversation between Jim and presumably Fred in the Lunar Module. His mics catch it up while Fred's replies are heard very faintly. We can only speculate what Jim was planning to do here upon returning home.
105:42:32|Fred is not wrong in his musings. Had they been following the regular flight plan, their landing was scheduled for 103:42:02 GET, exactly two hours previously. Fred is now gazing at the Moon where the lunar terminator nearly marks the spot.
105:44:52|The sound of circuit breakers being pulled can be heard over the radio.
105:52:40|Distance to go, 278,359 km, velocity 1,371 m/s.
106:04:49|Their distance is 277,800 km, velocity 1,371.6 m/s. Speed is picking up very slowly still due to the weak, if dominant pull of the Earth's gravity.
|The fifth day of the mission of Apollo 13 continues. A manual course correction has made the crew of Apollo 13 as well as Mission Control more confident that they will be re-entering the Earth atmosphere in an angle that will result in a successful landing. With 38 hours to go they are drifting towards the Earth with a slowly increasing speed as the gravitational pull grows stronger. With the ground working to finish up the details on the procedures for returning to the Command Module, the crew must patiently wait, while also looking out for any additional trouble springing up.
|Their distance from Earth is 277,256 km, speed is 1,374 m/s.
106:34:23|The crew has slept very poorly since the accident, due to the shock and stress, as well as the very uncomfortable sleeping quarters provided by the unpowered Command Module. Although Mission Control attempted to set up a work rotation, the crew has not been adhering to it completely.
106:35:14|Mission Control is using the radio and radar tracking to establish 13's exact trajectory. Although the supercritical helium is designed to vent in a fashion that does not create a propulsive effect - like was the case with the leak from the O2 tank during the accident, for example - they still fear that it might disturb their trajectory and require correction further along the way home. In better news from Jack, they are not in danger of running out of power, water and oxygen, with projected lifetime reaching to 152 GET, or ten hours past their landing time at 142 GET.
106:35:54|Jack is talking about the cooling water, not drinking water here.
106:36:56|With their stringent power down procedures and the LM's large supply of oxygen, the water still remains the bottleneck in the lifetime of the spacecraft.
106:37:44|Normally, the crew reports on their physical condition and possible medication use twice a day, before and after bedtime. These formal reports have not taken place since the accident, and have been reduced to occasional comments instead.
106:38:03|Although Jack says they haven't taken any medication, the post-flight report does indicate that medication was taken at some point after the accident as well. This includes Fred being heard on the radio loop asking for aspirin, which he is known to have taken before the accident for his headaches as well. Since the medical kit is in the Command Module, it is very much possible for crewmembers to take drugs from it there without the astronaut in the LM knowing about this. It is possible that none had been taken at this point, that Jack simply didn't know or forgot to mention it, or he didn't want to talk about it on the open radio loop.
106:46:03|Judging by their canister changing schedule, numbers 5 and 6 were in the ECS during the accident. This means that they grabbed the next fresh ones on the list, to take down to the LM.
107:08:10|They are again using the markings on the LM window to see if their motion relative to the Earth or the Moon is changing.
107:08:10|Distance, 272,588 km to go.
107:08:10|Venting the tanks of helium would not be an especially difficult task, as this procedure is performed shortly after the LM landing. In the procedure, the pyro batteries are brought online, and the vent valves are opened by a pyrotechnic charge. Individually, the fuel and oxidizer tanks on the commanders Panel 8 are vented.
107:08:10|While the procedure is quite straightforward, the effects on the spacecraft attitude is not. The propellant tank vents are not designed to be “non - propulsive”, that is, there are no means to limit a particular directional force on the spacecraft. They are, after all, intended to be used after landing, where the impulse of the escaping helium would be moot.
107:08:10|The two options, venting the helium all at once, or in stages is the debate currently ongoing at Flight Director Milton Windler’s console. If the burst disk fails to open the tank vent, completely dumping the contents of the SHe tank might induce a trajectory change. Dumping helium in stages, however, would minimize and attitude or trajectory effects, but the pressure would have to be constantly monitored and vented periodically.
107:59:27|Earth is now 268,462 km away. Their velocity is 1,406 m/s.
107:59:27|The freezing of the fuel line was first seen during Apollo 11. At a frigid - 445 &deg;F (-265 &deg;C, 8 &deg;K), the supercritical helium liquid needs to be warmed and converted to a gas, lest it freezes the fuel and oxidizer when it is introduced into the propellant tanks. A heat exchanger wraps the helium line around the fuel line, and uses the heat in the fuel for warming the helium into a gas. In this exchange, the fuel is also cooled, but is in little danger of freezing as fresh, warm fuel is always passing through the heat exchanger when the engine is firing. Only when the descent engine has stopped is where fuel freezing becomes an issue. Venting helium, will quickly freeze the stagnant Aerozine -50 fuel, leaving it in a state that is potentially explosive. Unlike Apollo 11, where the still warm descent engine melted the fuel, no such heat source is available on Aquarius. Aside from the potential danger that a frozen slug of fuel presents, the descent engine is now rendered unusable. This is not considered a major constraint, as their course is very good, and any minor midcourse correction can be performed by the RCS system.
108:25:14|Their entry angle is good enough that correction is not vital at this point, although may be done in the future, should the tracking indicate it is necessary.
108:27:04|Jack's first two shifts coincided with the crew sleep period, hence giving him very little to do in terms of actually communicating with them. This all changed with the accident. Since then someone has always been up in <i>Aquarius</i>, and both the CapCom and the crewman on duty have taken the opportunity to chitchat.
108:57:20|The helium pressure display in the LM is powered down, hence Jim has to resort to ask Lousma for the telemetered value instead.
109:01:28|The helium venting has caused them to reverse the PTC, and spin up faster than earlier. For the moment, they don't want to do anything about it, since that would be a time and power-consuming effort.
109:16:23|The initial comment about rotation in this PAO transcript is somewhat puzzling.
109:31:13|Distance to go, 251,001 km, velocity 1,432 m/s.
110:01:46|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Actually, Fred, you got some good sleep?&quot;
110:01:46|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Yes,I did.&quot;
110:01:46|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Yes. You slept that one time in the tunnel very well.&quot;
110:01:46|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;And one time in the CM. I think you got about 4 or 5 hour's good sleep.&quot;
110:01:46|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;My sleep was very sporadic.&quot;
110:01:46|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I would sleep in the tunnel next to the ECS unit. This was the warmest place. And I got in the sleep restraint and slept upside down in the tunnel with my face back towards the hatch. I zipped up my sleep restraint and used a string on it to hook myself to the hatch handle on the LM hatch so I wouldn't drift away. It must have looked very strange.&quot;
110:08:26|Their powerdown has reduced the water usage in the LM and extended the expected lifetime of the system considerably.
|It is nearing the end of the fifth day of the mission. Their latest efforts have included making a manually fired course correction, and setting up a new Passive Thermal Control rotation before pulling the power from all systems besides life support and the radio. While the crew has been given instructions on how to transfer power from the LM batteries into the Command Module, they are still missing the plan on how to re-start the Odyssey's systems for their Earth reentry some 32 hours away.
|Distance to go 257,732 km, velocity, 1446,3 m/s, up some 14 m/s from the previous PAO checkpoint.
|Even with the supercritical helium gone, the residual gas pressure in the DPS propellant system allows them some 244 m/s of thrust for any last minute course correction needs, besides the capacity in the LM RCS.
110:14:58|Jim Lovell's family home is in Timber Cove, near Houston. It is on the western shore of Taylor Lake, northeast from the Manned Spacecraft Center about 4 miles away.
110:15:16|El Lago is the home of Jack Lousma, Fred Haise's family, and many other astronauts who have been involved in the mission. It sits on the eastern shore of Taylor Lake, right across from Timber Cove.
110:23:40|There are several interesting points in this long read up from Jack, including many open operational questions that need to be solved before the reentry.
110:23:40|Spacecraft simulators have been essential during the mission, both in testing upcoming checklist procedures and for simulating the unusual maneuvering characteristics of the LM-CSM stack. Both the Command Module and the Lunar Module Simulators have been busy in this regard, and they have also taken part in "integrated" simulations - meaning that both simulators have been manned and the crews have tested procedures where both spacecraft are simultaneously involved. Lousma envisions that a future simulation will also involve Mission Control, where the controllers may view the simulator-generated data on their consoles the same way as if they were receiving telemetry from the MSFN and the real ship in space.
110:23:40|The OPS are the backup oxygen supplies for the moonwalkers. The crew has contemplated whether they should take them onboard the Command Module for reentry to supply them with oxygen besides the surge tank and the repress package in the CM. They do also pose problems if they should be used for this purpose. They are heavy, at 40 pounds (18.1 kg) each, and contain extremely high pressure oxygen. The crew would have to be able to strap them on carefully so as not to have the OPS fly around the cabin once they begin to experience deceleration.
110:23:40|No Apollo crew has reentered with suits since Apollo 7. Right now, there are some doubts over whether they can fully trust the Command Module docking hatch.
110:23:40|The LM separation is usually a combination of firing pyrotechnics and using the Service Module RCS for an evasive maneuver. During Apollo 10, a mechanical failure in the docking tunnel venting system forced them to jettison the LM with the tunnel pressurized. This created a burst of thrust from the volume of gas in the tunnel and pushed the LM away at a higher speed than usual.
110:25:46|Although Lovell keeps breaking up at first due to the poor radio signal, it is obvious that he is not very keen on a suited entry. The bulky suits, even when unpressurized, would severely hamper their ability to move between the two docked spacecraft.
110:31:24|Jim suggests that they could save power and resources by using the PLSS inside the Command Module to provide them with oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> removal. However, knowing how much oxygen remains in the CM's own stores, he doesn't see this as something they must do.
110:35:36|This initial idea proposed by Jack Lousma here is that they would use the Earth terminator to align the LM and then use the AGS' <b>400 +50000</b> function to align the AGS' attitude reference to the body axes of the spacecraft. With the 8-ball enabled via the AGS, they can then maneuver the stack and offer them a chance to do a coarse align of the Command Module's IMU using sightings of the Moon, and later do a Moon-Sun check for the fine alignment of the CM inertial platform.
110:41:49|Lousma describes an interesting way to coarse align the IMU here. The plan is to activate the AGS and align it to the Earth terminator, hence the LM has an attitude reference. AGS can be then used to rotate the spacecraft stack so that the Command Module optics have the Moon, or possibly a star - centered in the sextant. From this, they can derive the values of NOUN 20 (ICDU ANGLES Y,P,R) for the Command Module Computer. Normally they would use the optics to tell the computer where the Moon is at the particular time, by pressing the 'Mark' button on the Optics console. This sends the computer angular information on the pointing angle of the sextant, which is then fed into the CDU - the Coupling Data Unit - and the information is sent to the computer to derive the present IMU orientation based on the angle. Here they skip the whole marking routine by providing this information from Mission Control where it can be derived mathematically using the angular information they already have.
110:43:01|They are joking about the fact that they plan to use the computer-controlled guidance system for the landing, instead of the more rudimentary, if functional Stabilization Control System-based backup of using the EMS display to guide them to a manual landing.
110:43:06|Lousma probably joins in on the joking by suggesting that usually in their simulations, the primary guidance is the one to fail and they are forced to go for a manual SCS-assisted reentry instead of using PGNCS.
110:46:46|Once again they are implying that something special must've been in the food locker, but we are not privy to this information.
110:48:58|Although the crew was unable to install the hatch earlier, during the accident, Lousma implies that the main reason for the Mission Control's doubts about its integrity is the fact that the hatch has not been used in the mission-specified manner, including depressurizations and repressurizations as well as undocking and redocking at the lunar orbit. All these procedures, plus the three-day coast back home, gives the crew ample time to perform tests on the seal to make sure that the Command Module is indeed airtight.
110:54:42|A preliminary checklist was read up to the crew earlier at 095:13 GET, and is going to be amended now. Jack is in charge of the Command Module documentation, including the new procedures.
110:54:47|The previous checklist started with ASCENT ECA breakers being closed, followed by the aforementioned ASCENT ECA CONT breakers. This step is now eliminated.
110:55:17|The new checklist only switches one of the two Ascent Stage batteries into the EPS.
110:55:30|The new procedure resets all the four Descent Stage batteries and removes the period of conditioning that had been previously considered for them.
110:57:23|Jack recalls the procedure to set up the Command Module's power system to receive current from the LM. This amounts to connecting the two spacecraft together with the umbilicals and setting the circuit breakers and switches into the correct position so that an electrical current can flow from the LM to the Command Module once battery charge begins.
110:59:20|This leaves 5 of the 6 LM batteries on the line.
111:00:46|The electric current in the LM umbilical during normal coasting flight does not usually go past approximately 5 amps, used by the LM equipment heaters. Working the umbilical at the maximum capacity allowed by the circuit breakers will cause more of the electric current to be wasted as heat, and hence heat up the cable.
111:01:22|Jack is probably meaning to ask about the LM here, rather than the Command Module.
111:04:20|Lousma's reply is a diplomatic 'no' at best to Jack's concerns.
111:04:47|Jack is relaying his Commander's worries here, although he must have shared them with both of his crewmates. Using the LM umbilical essentially in reverse like this is not what it has been designed to do, but thanks to the emergency planning, its capacity to supply power the other way around is a known variable and has been ready to be implemented at least since Apollo 11. It is likely that the crews had not practiced it during simulations, however. The word from Mission Control is that everything should go fine, since they are not abusing the hardware.
111:05:25|These 20 amp hours are really what stands between their safe return and possibly running out of power during reentry.
111:08:28|This lengthy procedure connects the depleted Battery A into the power bus in the Command Module, powers the instrumentation needed to monitor the battery charging, plus connects inverter 2 and the battery charger to Main Bus B.
111:10:51|These steps set up battery A to be charged, and for AC BUS 2 to power the battery charger.
111:12:15|The MAIN BUS TIE switches connect the batteries to the main buses. They want the batteries to be offline, of course, while being charged.
111:12:39|This switch selects the AC INVERTER 2 to supply alternating current to Main Bus B.
111:13:58|These final steps start the actual battery charger. They power up the AC BUS 2, select the battery charger mode to battery A, and then rotate the DC display selector so that the instrument on the console will show the voltage and amperage of the battery charge.
111:13:58|Since the telecommunications and telemetry remains unpowered, the crew is in charge of reporting the progress of the battery charge to Mission Control with regular updates.
111:15:49|The nature of the power transfer and the battery charger means that for the 20 amp hours transferred, they spend 120 amp hours overall, with those 100 amps lost to the process.
111:20:03|Jack wants to know how to stop the battery charge in an emergency. He is told not to touch the LM power selector switch in the Command Module, because the RESET position could cut off the connection. Hence he is told to simply pull the two LM POWER breakers that connect the LM umbilical directly to Main Bus B.
111:23:59|These steps simply turn off the charger and removes battery A from the power system.
111:24:52|This is reversal of the earlier procedure, which amounts to opening the breakers they closed earlier to power up the system.
111:34:33|This issue was dramatized in the Ron Howard film, but with some inaccuracy. The movie implied that they needed to add ballast to the Command Module to alter their approach corridor before re-entering Earth atmosphere. Their true concern is, however, of weighing down one part of the Command Module so that they would approximate their normal return weight distribution, for which the whole landing profile is designed for. Jack is concerned that without the usual ballast there - the moon rocks in their heavy boxes - they will need to come up with something else to put there to maintain this weight ratio.
111:35:19|Jack is probably taking a playful jab at Lousma, who is a member of the US Marine Corps while Swigert himself is a U.S. Air Force pilot.
111:35:40|This opens the two circuit breakers that govern the power flow between the two spacecraft. The third breaker supplies power to the EPS instrumentation.
111:38:42|Swigert has noticed an issue in the nomenclature being used. The two LM POWER circuit breakers are called LM POWER 1 and LM POWER 2, and they both supply power from Main Bus B. It is uncertain where the confusion arose in Mission Control, but Jack is quick to catch onto it.
111:40:20|This procedure momentarily disconnects the LM's Battery 1 and Battery 2, first by turning on the low volt taps and then returning to the high volt taps.
111:43:21|The much-feared helium venting from the supercritical pressurization tank has thankfully not caused any changes to their entry trajectory.
111:49:02|Since only one comm headset is being used at any given time, the mic captures partial conversations between the crew here.
111:51:05|Albeit spoken in joking terms, they could be referring to Fred's increasingly unwell state due to his worsening urinary infection.
111:55:47|Fred's question concerns a peculiarity of the LM's Electric Power System, and especially the part that is in the Ascent Stage. Each of the Ascent batteries usually powers one of the power distribution systems, known as Commander's and System Engineer's Buses. Battery 6, which is to be the only one remaining online, supplies only its usual half, the Commander's side, although a switch exists to switch it over to the other bus in case of a bus failure. For now, however, they are using the cross tie connection between the two buses to share the load on both buses with only one battery. The small load of 11 amps makes this not an issue at all.
111:56:58|Jack confirms that Fred has reconfigured the communications systems to provide normal voice function and high bit telemetry.
111:59:38|With Fred operating the LM batteries, Jack heads to the Command Module to set up his breakers and switches for the charge.
112:07:54|The accident happened at 55:55:00 GET, or so. The LM was powered up at 57:41:00 GET, which means that by now it has operated for almost 55 hours. The original flight plan designated LM operations for between 96:30 GET and 143:04 GET, or just 47 hours. They've already passed that well by now.
112:08:38|The joke hits very close to home. Fred spent a great amount of time at the LM construction plant, being one of the astronauts in charge of the development of the spacecraft that would land him and his colleagues on the Moon one day.
112:08:38|The LM builders at Grumman were rightfully proud of the performance of their spacecraft. They even issued a joke invoice to the CM builders at North American Rockwell, charging them for such items as towing the Command Module back to Earth for 400,000 miles, a battery charge (with customer's own booster cables) and sleeping quarters for 2 with an extra bed for a third guest.
112:08:38|Various versions of the towing invoice exist, many with dubious provenance. Contemporary photos do exist and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/apollo-13-mrs-lovell-at-splashdown/UQFWlLJqivFNZg" target="_blank">are held in the archive of the LIFE magazine.</a>. Newspapers mentioned the invoice already at the time of their landing, hence we can assume that it was made in public already at the time. Whether it was actually sent to North American Rockwell remains unknown. However, the invoice does exist and provides a rare moment of levity in the narrative of Apollo 13.
112:08:51|Distance to go, 248,168 km, velocity clocking in at 1,493 m/s.
112:10:04|Jack is referring to the pressure being 1,937 psia at the time the burst disk popped.
112:14:06|El Lago is the Haise family's home in Houston as well. Jack and Jim were discussing home life earlier on, and now Lousma is passing the same news to Fred as well.
112:16:42|The comm quality has degraded once again due to the switch to the low power mode.
112:16:42|Distance to go is 246,609 km and their velocity has increased to 1,491 m/s.
112:16:42|PAO talks about the state of the Flight Plan here, and implies that despite the Mission Control's attempts at maintaining their work and rest cycle, it's up to the crew to actually do so.
112:24:44|Jack is checking up whether they have pulled the circuit breaker on the S-Band power amplifier, to save that power.
112:26:34|Removing the power amplifier from the line has reduced the comm quality again. Besides that, their PTC rotation is angled in a manner that means that they are having a hard time keeping one of the two antennas continuously pointed at Earth.
112:35:39|The voltage has rised a little, which is a sign that the battery charge procedure is working.
112:49:07|It's just past 6 in the morning in Houston.
112:49:07|Jack makes a military joke here, as a United States Marine Corps officer, by quoting the Fifth General Order for Sentries, which states that they are "To quit my post only when properly relieved."
112:49:07|Way to go, 243,930 km, velocity, 1,502 m/s.
112:49:07|243,400 km to go, 1,504 m/s.
113:15:15|To ensure that they have enough capacity to remove the carbon dioxide, Joe Kerwin is giving te crew a procedure on how to tape up a second LiOH canister onto the one already in place so that air will be drawn through both of the canisters.
113:25:01|Joe's comment implies that the recharge is being recorded with a hand drawn graph in Mission Control.
113:40:28|The CPCB is the Crew Procedures Control Board, a body responsible for planning every onboard operation of their equipment and gear. Since usually such things are decided months in advance, Joe and Fred are having a bit of fun on that matter.
113:59:21|In normal procedure, 39 volts would indicate that the battery is fully charged.
114:18:35|They've travelled 24,076 kilometers closer to home during Joe's CapCom shift.
114:19:39|Their current velocity is 9,334 kilometers per hour, and increasing.
114:31:07|The crew offered their opinion on this scheme afterwards.
114:31:07|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Houston came through with a technique for using CM LiOH canisters in the LM, which worked probably as well as the basic system. We ended up with a complete primary LiOH canister that we didn't use. And that was 40 hours worth of running.&quot;
114:31:07|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;We had more canisters in the CM which we could have just added onto this thing. . I felt we had an unlimited supply of LiOH canis ers.&quot;
114:31:07|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;So even though we probably didn't even have to go through that other mode, it kept us busy. It's like putting up the antenna in a liferaft. Does it work? Maybe it'll keep you busy for a while.&quot;
114:31:58|Distance to go, 233,406 km, velocity is up to 1,547 m/s.
114:58:41|The vacuum perigee stands at 43,7 km.
115:00:24|The waste water dumps could create a small but perceivable alteration in their trajectory, due to the fact that anything coming out of the spacecraft will impart a propulsive force. These waste water dumps had hence to be taken into account while planning and monitoring the trajectory.
115:00:24|The crew offered some notes about their toilet habits in the debriefing, besides Jack's joking on air.
115:00:24|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I would have approached the last item a lot differently if I had known the way this mission was going to turn out. If I had known the mission was going to last less than 6 days, I would have gone the route of no bulk foods, and I'd have cavitated the whole system back to the tummy as best I could with enemas and everything else , and I think we'd probably got by the whole time without having to worry about it. As it was, I went three times in 5 days. It's a terrible inconvenience. Jack did the same, and I think that was just because he continued to eat. With a 10-day mission, I don't think you're going to avoid the issue.&quot;
115:00:24|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;That's the way I felt before launch. I'd gone through this low-residue-food, clean-yourself-out-good routine at night. Then, I went through the entire flight without going. I said to myself, "One of these days, you're going to face facts that you just can't last 28 days or 56 days without going. You might as well start living normally again." So, that's what I did. I went once.&quot;
115:09:42|They're 230,807 km out and coming in at 1,559 m/s.
115:45:37|Battery 2 is once again showing indications of malfunction on the warning system, although all readouts are still normal.
116:30:21|Vacuum perigee refers to the closest point to Earth sea level, with consideration to an imaginary Earth with no atmosphere on it. Should that be the case, they would zoom around the Earth at that altitude and then head to a new trajectory. With the atmosphere very much present, however, this will take them deep into it, enough for them to deccelerate to landing.
116:30:56|They're 223,347 km away, and clocking in at 1,593 m/s.
117:06:35|The water warning is set to go off when the quantity of water in the Descent Stage water tank drops below 16%. They have used up most of the water in the big Descent tank. Sufficient water remains in the Ascent stage tanks to complete their trip home.
117:06:35|218,184 kilometers remain, with their speed now up to 1,618 m/s.
117:51:46|Jack attempts to sleep in the back of the Lunar Module, on top of the Ascent Engine cover. According to Fred Haise, the LM ECS unit produced some precious heat for anyone sleeping in that part of the cabin.
117:52:22|During normal landing operations, the Command Module's cooling systems are brought to maximum power before re-entry so that the spacecraft will act as a heat sink for the onboard equipment during the reentry. This does not affect the heat shield or the actual skin of the spacecraft, however, which are not subject to active cooling. The whole spacecraft is more than likely much colder now than at any point during a normal mission.
117:52:27|North American Rockwell is the primary contractor for the Command and Service Module.
118:28:14|The sleep restraints were there for comfort, not for producing warmth, as they are, and offer little protection from the cold in the 51 Fahrenheit (10.5-degrees Celsius) LM cabin.
118:28:50|Although it might sound like a perfect idea to put on their space suits to keep warm, the crew had their reasoning against it as well.
118:28:50|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Right now it's still a little bit hazy in my mind whether we should have donned the suits. Without the suits, we were so much more maneuverable, especially in getting rid of urine and moving around, that I was reluctant to put on the suits.&quot;
118:28:50|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;The problem with suits is that your body can't breathe in them. With no hoses plugged in, there is no flow. Even as cold as it was, inside the suit one starts getting hot and sweaty. You've got to crawl out of them about every 2 hours. Then, you're exposed soaking wet to that chilly atmosphere.&quot;
118:44:45|Jim is starting to sound impatient over the fact that with less and less time remaining before reentry, they are still without the procedures for their return.
118:57:05|This moment was reenacted humorously in the Ron Howard film of Apollo 13. Here Tom Hanks' Jim Lovell tapped the frozen solid sausage against the AOT handles, resulting in a resounding noise.
118:57:05|The Technical Crew Debriefing related another funny sausage-related incident.
118:57:05|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;We had one emergency in the LM that you didn't know about.&quot;
118:57:05|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Fred vent up to get a volts and amps reading, and he said "Here, hold my Frankfurter." When he came back I said, "Fred, I got an emergency here. I squeezed too hard and it difted off someplace." I said, "Check around for two loose frankfurters." That broke Fred up for about 5 minutes. I was still holding that empty package when he came back. We had a few laughs over this one.&quot;
118:57:05|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I thought you had eaten them, that's why. You just can't trust these CMPs when you leave them in charge of the LM. The Spoon-bowl packages worked pretty well.&quot;
118:57:05|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;That's a step in the right direction.&quot;
119:12:49|207,839 kilometers remain, while their velocity has increased to 1,670 m/s.
|It is April 16th, 1970, just after 1 PM in Houston, from where Mission Control continues to monitor the return of Apollo 13. The spacecraft is approximately 22 hours away from its calculated reentry into Earth atmosphere. Fred Haise and Jack Swigert have set up their respective spacecraft so that they are now transferring battery power from the Lunar Module into the Command Module's battery A. This battery was used to keep the Odyssey running while they struggled to transfer navigational data between the two spacecraft just after the accident. Now, they are using this unusual procedure to top up the battery so that they will have a sufficient amount of electric power stored in the Odyssey for the two hours between separating the LM and splashing down. What they still need, besides the power, is the checklist on how to configure the Command Module for this potentially hazardous reentry.
119:59:48|Jim is making a reference to a popular radio show that aired during his childhood.
120:01:06|To follow the progress of the Command Module battery charge, the crew has to float up to the Odyssey and read out the voltage and amperage of the battery charge display.
120:18:35|Their distance is 201,622 km, their velocity is up to 1,702 m/s. With 22 hours to go until splashdown, they are still halfway between the Earth and the Moon, and will cover the rest of the distance at an ever-increasing pace thanks to the growing gravitional pull of the Earth.
120:22:26|To get a better radio signal during the important talk, they close the circuit breaker to provide power to the S-Band radio power amplifier and and go to VOICE on the radio mode selection, meaning that they are now using the primary radio electronics instead of the backup system they have been using to save power.
120:22:27|The philosophy behind the reactivation checklist includes using the pre-existing onboard materials when possible, just like they have done so far with their course correction burns using the LM Contingency Activation procedures.
120:23:36|This is a rundown of the events expected up until their reentry. We will be elaborating on them soon when the actual checklist is read up to the crew.
120:30:00|To ensure that the Command Module RCS jets are ready to be used, they must be warmed up after their days in deep space. To do so, power is applied to the DIRECT coils inside them which double as heaters besides being the backup manual way of firing each thruster. This consumes 1.875 amps of current per thruster, for a total current of 22.5 amps which is 630 watts. The LM umbilicals can only supply 15 amps at maximum due to the circuit breaker limits. There is also the matter that the LM umbilical power can only be directly applied to Main Bus B, while each of of the CM RCS rings are connected only to one main bus - hence both buses must be powered to provide heating for both CM RCS systems.
120:30:52|They plan to attain their desired attitude by using the Abort Guidance System (AGS) to run the 8-ball Flight Director/Attitude Indicator for reference. Later on, once the Command Module is powered up, they can go back to their usual procedure of uplinking attitude data into the computer.
120:32:55|The LM/CM combination is one that has never been flown before, hence the biggest question mark in terms of behavior.
120:34:23|They are very keen to take photos of the damaged Service Module, but they must also preserve their RCS fuel, and not to make any undue maneuvers that might still alter their reentry trajectory.
120:35:00|One way for the crew to ensure that they have the proper attitude for reentry is to see whether a known reference star can be viewed through their optics instruments at a given time. Some question now remains whether their IMU will be accurate enough for them to be able to point their primary optics - the sextant - at such a target. They can use the COAS on the CM window for a more rudimentary, but still applicable check.
120:36:20|The hatch is slightly suspect, and hence the possibility of putting on the spacesuits remains on the table. The main disadvantages are voiced by Joe as well. The cumbersome suits would make any activity many times more difficult. It is also not possible to wear the suits for any period of time without having them actively cooled by having a constant flow of air through them. To do this, they would have to power one of the suit compressors, using 2 amps of their battery power.
120:39:45|In normal operations, hitting the SM SEP switches will fire the pyrotechnics to separate the Command and Service Modules. This automatic sequence will also fire the Service Module RCS jets to separate the two sections safely. At the moment, the Service Module has neither working RCS nor fuel cell power to do so. Hence they plan to use the LM's RCS jets to give the whole stack a little shove and then use this momentum to push the service module away, while an immediate thrusting to the opposite direction will null their own motion and instead cause them to separate properly.
120:46:39|With their talk done, they power down the radio once more.
121:50:55|Vance will now read the list of equipment being moved between the two spacecraft for the reentry. Proper stowage is essential for the mass distribution in the Command Module, and for the crew safety. During the deccceleration, anything that is not tied down will be thrown around the cabin, with potentially lethal consequences.
121:50:55|Vance is using the word 'Delta' as a shorthand for change, the same way a change in velocity is referred to as delta-V by the crews.
121:52:02|The DSEA stands or Data Storage Equipment Assembly, which is the LM's tape recorder. It is a portable piece of equipment, and will be taken to the Command Module.
121:52:43|LM Flight Data Files refers to all the documentation carried onboard. Not only will it be a good record of all the notes and checklist changes the crew has made during the flight, the heavy paper volumes will also provide some useful ballast for the Command Module requiring its weight distribution to be carefully adjusted for the reentry.
121:52:43|The PPKs or Pilot Preference Kits were small Beta cloth pouches the crew was allowed to fill with whatever non-mission related they wished to carry with them to space. Controversially, some elected to carry small items that could be lucratively sold afterwards as exclusive space-flown or moon-landed mementos. While a comprehensive listing of Apollo 13's PPK contents does not exist, small US flags and copies of the mission patch have surfaced in private auctions.
121:53:45|The black and white TV camera was a backup item in the LM, in case the more capable color camera was unavailable. Pete Conrad and Alan Bean destroyed their color camera during Apollo 12 almost as soon as it was deployed.
121:57:57|The ISA or Interim Stowage Assembly, is a series of bags on a metal frame that is used for storing various odds and ends during the mission. It was usually taken to the Command Module before LM jettison in lunar orbit.
121:59:36|The jettison bag's usual fate was to be dumped out of the LM once the crew stepped out, taking their trash with them. A picture of the Apollo 11 jettison bag on its final resting place <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5850.jpg" target="_blank"><b>can be viewed here</b></a> at our sister publication, Apollo Lunar Surface Journal.(ALSJ)
122:13:49|The crew must make the switch to high bit telemetry so that Mission Control can attempt to receive it.
122:18:51|Lovell confesses that they have removed their biomedical harnesses, and hence nobody is able to be plugged into the biotelemetry system.
122:19:58|Distance to go, 188,939 km, velocity, 1774 m/s. The cabin temperature is a chilly 11 degrees Celsius.
122:25:17|Their next step is to power up the instrumentation in the Command Module to get a look at the internal temperatures. In other news, the battery charge is well underway and they are closing in on their goal.
122:38:47|They're 187,052 km out and moving at 1,782.5 m/s. Earth gravity is beginning to accelerate their fall towards home.
122:47:46|The probe and drogue are heavy items, and they wouldn't want them to be bouncing around the LM after separation.
122:49:39|Mission Control wants them back to the low bit rate on their telemetry, after their earlier experiment in trying to receive high bit rate.
122:55:29|It can probably be assumed that they are using low power in the power amplifier due to the smaller distance between the spacecraft and the Earth, hence requiring less radio transmitter power.
122:56:04|Leaving this circuit breaker open prevents power from being drawn from the batteries. Instead, they will power up the Command Module ia the LM umbilicals.
122:58:10|Jack is mindful of their mass distribution again, and wants to keep putting heavy items to the Lower Equipment Bay to maintain it proper for the reentry.
122:58:51|One of the items Jack mentions are the sample return boxes which would contain the moon rocks they bring back home. These air tight boxes weigh about 24 pounds or 10.8 kg empty, and were built at the Y-12 plant, the home of the nuclear bomb and apparently well experienced in producing unusual hardware for government purposes.
122:58:51|A video of Neil Armstrong of Apollo 11 demonstrating the stowage of the sample return boxes <a href="https://youtu.be/DxHjpwHxf94?t=176" target="_blank">can be viewed here.</a>
122:58:51|This translates to 184,956 km, and 1797.4 m/s.
123:09:27|Their constant rotation has put the Command Module out of line of sight, and Jack needs to try to select an antenna that points at Earth.
123:12:20|The cabin temperature has dropped to 7.2-7.8 degrees Celsius.
123:12:59|The cold temperature and the high moisture level has caused everything in the Command Module to be covered in condensation. Fred's concern is that the photography will be difficult due to the poor visibility from the Command Module windows. Jim Lovell expressed further concerns due to the moisture later on.
123:12:59|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">Apollo Expeditions to the Moon (NASA SP-350, 1975):</span></b> &quot;The walls, ceiling, floor, wire harnesses, and panels were all covered with droplets of water. We suspected conditions were the same behind the panels. The chances of short circuits caused us apprehension, to say the least. But thanks to the safeguards built into the Command Module after the disastrous fire in January 1967, no arcing took place.&quot;
123:22:44|The values Jack reads out can be interpreted as below. The RCS temperatures and the battery manifold pressure are read out from the Systems Test Meter and interpreted using the onboard chart.
123:22:44|Battery B voltage -37 volts - normal.
123:22:44|Pyro battery A and B - 37 volts - normal
123:22:44|SPS helium pressure - 3,400 psi - this is the helium used to pressurize the SPS tanks, and is normal.
123:22:44|Nitrogen A - 2,200 / Nitrogen B - 2,400 psia - high-pressure nitrogen gas is used to operate valves in the SPS engine. This pressure is normal as well.
123:22:44|Command Module RCS injector temperatures - these range from +14 to +27 &deg; Fahrenheit, or -10 &deg; to -2.8 &deg; Celsius. They are freezing cold, but can be heated before use.
123:22:44|Battery manifold pressure - 5.6 psia - pressure in the line that is used to vent the batteries if they produce gas - like the LM batteries have done during the mission.
123:25:05|When the power was turned off in the Command Module after the accident, they were left with some 99 amps in the batteries.
123:45:53|Jack is wondering whether EECOM engineer John Aaron happens to be on duty. The young mission controller was currently involved in Gene Kran's special Tiger team work, attempting to figure out the plan for powering up the Command Module again. Aaron's reputation surely had reached the Astronaut Corps as well, considering that his quick action during the launch of Apollo 12 resulted in the flight continuing successfully despite a lightning strike that disabled their systems and the telemetry instrumentation. John Aaron hence originated the space enthusiast catchphrase "Try SCE to AUX."
123:45:53|Vance being unsure about John Aaron's work schedule is not so unsual, considering that the Capcoms did not work the same hours as the rest of the Mission Control team, but their own duty shifts had considerable overlap between team changes.
123:45:53|The AFJ commentary on the launch of Apollo 12, with the lightning strike incident <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap12fj/01launch_to_earth_orbit.html" target="_blank">can be viewed here.</a>
123:47:16|Their distance is 180,074 kilometers, their velocity up to 1,838 m/s.
123:54:03|Jack has been spotting some stars, presumably out of the window. He identifies the Southern Cross, a constellation which includes the Apollo navigational star Acrux (Star 25), the binary star Alpha/Beta Centauri (which is the closest star to our Sun), and Atria, Apollo navigational star 34.
123:58:51|Jack wants to get some drinking water from the LM's descent tank. He appears to be concerned that by pressurizing the Command Module tank with oxygen from the surge tank, they are spending a worrying amount of the O<sub>2</sub> reserve for their reentry.
124:06:01|This amounts to mere 2.2 desiliters, or about a drinking glass full of water.
124:06:18|The Command Module water was always rather bubbly due to the oxygen used to pressurize the system, as well as any remaining hydrogen bubbles due to the water's origin in the fuel cell system. The CM water usually also had a chlorine taste, due to the crew applying some every day to prevent the water from becoming contaminated with bacteria. The LM water is treated with iodine for the same purpose, and would have its own effect in the taste of the water.
124:06:18|Distance to go: 177,121 kilometers, velocity 1,846 m/s.
124:21:03|The currently serving FIDO, or Flight Dynamics Officer, is Bill Stoval.
124:39:05|Ken Mattingly has still not developed signs of the possible German measles infection that grounded him from the flight.
124:42:04|Vance's photography prescription can be tabulated as such:
124:42:04|<b>Camera used: Hasselblad 70-mm DC EL with Reseau Plate</b>
124:42:04|<b>Lens Focal Length: 80 mm</b>
124:42:04|<b>Film stock: 3400 (B&W) ( Panatomic-X black and white ASA 80)</b>
124:42:04|<b>Magazine: R or S (R will be used based on photo log)</b>
124:42:04|<b>Aperture: f:5.6</b>
124:42:04|<b>Shutter speed: 1/250th of a second</b>
124:45:52|<b>Camera used: Maurer Data Acquisition Camera 16 mm</b>
124:45:52|<b>Lens Focal Length: 75 mm</b>
124:45:52|<b>Film stock: SO-368 CEX (Ektachrome MS, color reversal, ASA 64)</b>
124:45:52|<b>Magazine: Not specified (FF will be used based on photo log)</b>
124:45:52|<b>Aperture: f:8</b>
124:45:52|<b>Shutter speed: 1/250th of a second</b>
124:45:57|<b>Camera used: Hasselblad 70-mm DC EL</b>

124:45:57|<b>Film stock: SO-368 CEX (Ektachrome MS, color reversal, ASA 64)</b>
124:45:57|<b>Magazine: Not specified (magazine N will be used)</b>
124:45:57|<b>Aperture: f:8</b>
124:45:57|<b>Shutter speed: 1/250th of a second</b>
124:48:35|Their distance is 172,845 kilometers, their velocity 1,874 m/s.
125:00:57|Vance made a promise of delivering the checklists around 123:30 GET, saying they should be ready by 124:30 GET, which is now overdue.
|In just a little over 17 hours, the Command Module of Apollo 13 is to splash down into the Pacific Ocean. While the crew has been performing various tasks to get them ready for their return home, the most important of them remains undone - the plan on how to power up the Odyssey in a manner that they will have all their crucial systems running, and keeping them powered on the batteries only.
125:19:27|Post-flight inspection found out that there was a considerable amount of water left in the potable water tank. It is likely that either the tank itself or the water pipes were frozen at this point, preventing the crew from getting more water out of it.
125:26:02|They are still monitoring the battery charge by having one of the crew read out the values from the onboard display and reading it down to the crew.
125:26:37|Jack Swigert is naturally the person for the job.
125:27:54|There has been another delay, this time to produce enough copies of the checklist to everyone who desires one in Mission Control.
125:30:50|Running out of drinking water is going to add to the crew's severe discomfort, and leads to dehydration.
125:34:28|These refer to information on the various attitudes they will take during the last hours of the mission to accomplish various crucial maneuvers and procedures, including leaving the Service Module behind and rotating the spacecraft stack around to make their navigational observations.
125:35:44|The plan is to use the LM to point the Command Module's optics at the Moon and the Sun to acquire the coarse align angles for the inertial platform.
125:36:21|For the last series of maneuvers, the IMU will be aligned to the Entry REFSMMAT. This puts their X-axis (the roll axis) along their direction of flight, with the Z axis on the negative radius.
125:40:34|Deke Slayton has popped onto the air to ground circuit to distract the crew with banter for the moment as they wait for the procedure reading to continue. The topic of the LM's 10-degrees Celsius temperature is as good as any.
125:47:22|The probe and the drogue are large items and would take up their precious living space in the LM.
125:48:57|According to the to Flight Operations Report, it was as early as 97 hours GET that Mission Control was in discussion on what the crew might drink should the CM water run out. Medical clearance was given to drink the cooling water from the PLSS backpacks, should that become necessary. The backpacks contained 8.3 pounds of water (some 3.4 liters) for a total of 15 pounds or 6.8 liters or water. Alternative supplies considered were the Command Module Survival kit's water canisters with another 15 pounds (6.8 liters) of water in them, and even the water in the tubing inside the Liquid Cooling Garments, which would be 1.5 pounds, or .7 liters of water.
125:57:10|This configuration removes Battery A from the line by pulling its circuit breakers, and then connecting Battery B to the power bus so that it can be charged using the LM umbilical power.
125:58:13|Distance to go is 165,571 km, speed, 1,923 m/s.
126:07:16|Jim's starting to sound bothered due to the constant delays to the promised procedures. He makes a valid point by noting that the crew needs time to familarize themselves with the procedures, besides getting some much needed rest before the time comes to enact them.
126:12:05|The regular chore of checking up the battery charge readouts continues.
126:13:32|The LM's radio system is once again configured to work on the primary electronics and with the power amplifier on to support a higher signal strength and hence a better sound quality for the careful task of writing down the checklists.
126:13:52|The implication is that there was a single hard copy of the checklist which was then taken out of Mission Control to be copied for everyone who wanted one.
126:14:43|Ken Mattingly has returned to Mission Control, this time to bring in the plan on how to revive <i>Odyssey</i> and bring his crewmates home.
126:15:42|Reproductions of the checklist can be accessed through the links throughout this chapter.
126:16:08|There are several potential reasons for Jack's remark here. It is perhaps that he is tired and can't keep up with the pace, or Ken is indeed going much faster than Jack is used to. Perhaps Ken, in his anxiety to get the procedures to the crew, speaks faster than he might do otherwise. He is an experienced CapCom in his own right, and would have given crew procedures over the radio before.
126:16:38|They currently don't have lithium hydroxide canisters installed in the Command Module's ECS slots. Should they forget to put some in, the cabin would quickly become saturated once they jettison the LM.
126:16:38|The ORDEAL box will be stowed, not needed for the landing, and they will also turn on the lights. As Jack will soon learn, even that is not as simple as it might seem.
126:17:47|These breakers supply power to the Entry Monitoring System from both main buses. These breakers would have been closed until this point. They want to save some power by not powering the EMS until needed.
126:18:14|This breaker connects Battery A to battery bus A.
126:18:39|This breaker connects Battery B to battery bus B.
126:19:00|This connects battery C to its own circuits, which can be used to relay its power to either of the battery buses.
126:19:27|This switch applies power from battery bus A to the MAIN BUS TIE as well as the telemetry and EPS indicators, and enables the battery A to be charged.
126:19:52|The same as for battery A.
126:20:16|These switches operate the remote motor switches to connect all the batteries into the main buses.
126:20:43|These breakers apply battery power into the battery relay bus. The battery relay bus uses battery power to provide electric power to fuel cell and inverter switching controls.
126:21:13|These breakers power the EPS telemetry and monitoring system.
126:22:15|This breaker connects Battery C directly to Main Bus A via the BAT B/C BUS TIE switch that was selected as ON earlier.
126:23:17|These two breakers supply power to telemetry sensors in the Service Module systems, and are hence not needed once they start powering up the Command Module. They have been useful during the return, however, for powering temperature and pressure sensors in the SPS system, for example, to give them an idea on how cold the spacecraft has gotten during the coast home.
126:24:03|This breaker applies power to the INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL breakers that Jack wrote down earlier.
126:24:37|These valves allow water to flow into the evaporators under the automatic system control.
126:26:33|The Command Module has its own series of 12 RCS thrusters, arranged into two independent systems known as rings 1 and 2. These are used to provide attitude control in both automatic and manually operated modes after separation from the Service Module for the last few minutes of spaceflight and during the first moments of atmospheric entry.
126:26:59|This circuit breaker supplies Main Bus B power to the Caution and Warning system.
126:27:15|This switch allows the selection between Caution and Warning system's two power supplies.
126:28:16|These breakers provide power to the main bus undervoltage sensing units.
126:33:08|The RCS hotfire is a test firing of the CM maneuvering jets.
126:33:59|Closing the IMU heater breaker will apply Main Bus B power - channeled from the LM this time around, via the umbilical - to the inertial platform, as the first step to attempt to bring it back to full functioning state after several days of cold condition. While Mission Control was confident that it could be restored to accurate operation, it was still mostly a question mark.
126:34:42|These two switches apply DC power from both Main Buses and AC power from both AC Buses to the Rotational Control system.
126:35:03|This switch enables the SCS logic buses.
126:35:20|RCS COMMAND switch position 'ON' enables automatic RCS jet selection by the control electrics for the desired maneuver.
126:36:09|The rotational hand controllers are locked to prevent inadvert firing of the thrusters.
126:36:57|Jack wondered if he should ask Mission Control's approval for going forward with the RCS procedure, but he gets told to do it as he pleases, since there won't be a working radio in the Command Module yet.
126:39:25|Part of their power saving plan is to switch some systems on and off as needed, as opposed to them being enabled constantly the way they would be in normal operation.
126:40:57|Their next procedure includes using the LM to rotate the Command Module's optics towards the Moon for the purpose of navigational sightings.
126:41:21|This enables power to be supplied to the computer from Main Bus B.
126:41:35|To save power, they want to put the Command Module Computer onto standby mode as soon as the power is turned on. To do so, they will select PRO on a code 00062 displayed on the DSKY. Early in the development of the computer, it was planned to be placed on standby during coasting flight, with the thinking being that the computer would not be needed to constantly compute the state vector ie. their position. The DSKY even had a dedicated STANDBY button as a shortcut to this. As their philosophy changed, so did the DSKY, and the standby mode was retained behind a code that has to be called up from the computer via the 00062.
126:43:29|Mission Control won't be able to monitor computer activity via telemetry, and hence they will need to do a verbal confirmation over the radio instead.
126:44:20|This breaker will enable power from Main Bus A to the sensors in the onboard systems.
126:44:42|This important breaker will power the heaters in the IMU using Main Bus A DC current.
126:45:01|Once they pull these breakers, the power connection to the LM will be severed. From then on, they will rely on the 120 or so amp hours in the Command Module reentry batteries.
126:45:22|This breaker supplies power to the Command Module Computer via Main Bus A.
126:46:19|The diodes protect the sensitive equipment against power surges. Main Bus A is supplied by one of the onboard batteries before they remove the LM umbilical power.
126:46:48|This breaker connects Battery Bus B to Main Bus B.
126:47:08|There are four circuit breakers, which supply power from the main buses to the the three AC inverters.
126:47:33|These two breakers connects batteries A and B to the battery relay bus. This particular bus provides power to power switching and control equipment, such as the ones they are manipulating at this time.
126:47:54|These breakers supply power via the battery relay bus to the switches on the Main Display Console that are used for selecting the inverters.
126:48:13|This turns on the AC inverter 1, drawing DC power from Main Bus A. This will produce alternating current power to the CM systems that require it.
126:48:38|This enables AC power from AC inverter 1 to the AC BUS 1 to distribute alternating current power to systems connected to it.
126:49:04|This step connects Inverter 1 to AC BUS 2 as well.
126:49:56|These breakers supply AC power to the AC buses and their indicators and undervoltage detector circuits.
126:50:21|These breakers supply DC power from the battery buses to the AC detector circuits.
126:50:41|This breaker supplies Main Bus A DC power to the Caution and Warning electronics.
126:51:09|These switches reset any warnings on the respective AC buses and reconnect the inverter to the buses, should that be necessary.
126:51:35|These breakers supply Main Bus A and B power to the Flight Bus. This independent power bus distributes electricity to the communications equipment.
126:52:05|These breakers power the Central Timing Equipment, or CTE. Its main purpose is to synchronise onboard equipment to a standard timebase, especially in the absence of the computer that can also provide a timing signal via its own clock frequency.
126:52:23|This switch selects AC Bus 1 to power the Telecommunications Group 1 power system.
126:52:38|This switch does the same to Group 2, powered from AC Bus 2.
126:52:56|This select the primary S-Band radio electronics. They are now starting to power up the radio in the Command Module.
126:53:12|This selects the primary power source for the Signal Conditioning Equipment, which produces telemetry data to be sent to Mission Control over the S-Band radio. It of course has the alternative, famous AUX position.
126:53:24|The PMP stands for the Premodulation Processor, which conditions the signals in the communications system. It too has two possible power sources to ensure redundancy.
126:53:47|This resets any possible Up Telemetry remote commands that might have been sent to the system.
126:54:05|This selection on the switch will allow Mission Control to uplink crucial data into the CMC to get it back up to date after the restart.
126:54:26|These two breakers supply Main Bus A and B power to the Flight and Postlanding Bus. As the name implies, this separate bus powers systems needed after their splashdown, including ventilation, onboard lighting, recovery light flash beacon as well as the crew communication panels.
126:54:51|Panel 6 is the LMP's comms, while panel 9 is Commander's comms. Panel 10 is on the lip of the docking tunnel, and supplies CMP's comms control. The cables that connect their comm headest into the system plug into receptacles on the left hand side of the cabin, not at the individual panels, however. This reduces cable clutter in the Command Module by having all of them go to a single source.
126:55:23|This long-awaited step will apply power to the Inertial Measurement Unit.
126:55:41|These breakers provide power to the Command Module optics.
126:56:01|This circuit breaker governs AC power to the optics system.
126:56:18|This switch selects AC Bus 2 as the source of power to the guidance and navigation system. It is mostly used to run the lighting system, which needs AC power.
126:56:44|With the computer put on standby in an earlier step in the checklist, Jack will simply press the PRO button until the computer reactivates itself. He will then key in 00 at the sight of the flashing VERB 37, which is demanding him to choose the program. Punching in 00 ENTER puts the computer into P00, or idle mode, to await further instructions. It is good to remember that P00 idling and Standby are two separate modes, and not the same.
126:58:13|P27, or Program 27, is used to load information in the computer's erasable memory. With the computer started up, they will use P27 to update the onboard time, the state vector information, as well as the REFSMMATs they need for setting up their IMU to the preferred reference matrix for the reentry. Ken will soon elaborate further on this procedure.
126:58:50|Jack is referring to the computer update, rather than the procedures, which will keep on coming now.
126:59:46|This breaker powers the Mission Timer - the digital clock on the Main Display Console.
127:00:29|The methodology was discussed briefly before, but will now be described in detail to Jack, who will be using this advice to get the IMU running again.
127:00:45|This is a very long readup from Ken. The main idea, however, is to align the Command Module inertial platform based on gimbal angles derived from the known orientation of the Lunar Module. They plan to refine the alignment taking sightings of the Moon and the Sun - using these targets eliminates their running issues with poor visibility of stars through the optics. Should they be able to see the stars, however, the crew can proceed to do the realignment with star sightings, just like any other such realignment during a normal mission.
127:05:08|VERB 41 (COARSE ALIGN CDU) NOUN 20 (PRESENT ICDU ANGLES) coarse aligns the IMU to angles input via the DSKY. This will be used as basis for the upcoming P52 realignment.
127:05:45|VERB 40 (ZERO ICDU) NOUN 20 (PRESENT ICDU ANGLES) zeroes the Coupling Data Unit that interfaces between the IMU and the computer, and will allow the IMU to start sensing their motion and acceleration.
127:05:53|The REFSMMAT and drift flags will tell the computer that they have a valid inertial reference.
127:06:33|VERB 37 (CHANGE PROGRAM) 52 selects Program 52, the Inertial Measurement Unit Align. Option 1 allows them to input pre-calculated gimbal angles into the platform as part of the alignment.
127:06:49|They will use the gimbal angles to torque the platform - to use its electric motors to drive it into the desired orientation. From then on, they will proceed to perform a fine align, to maximize the accuracy of the platform.
127:09:03|They will perform the fine align on the platform by taking sightings of the Earth and the Moon and marking the positions into the computer. Afterwards, NOUN 93 will drive the gimbals to hence-determined fine orientation.
127:09:38|The newly aligned platform can go to a gimbal lock if the middle gimbal angle (on the roll axis) exceeds 90 degrees. It is possible for this to happen when the LM maneuvers them around, since the two spacecraft have different roll axes and the safe LM maneuver may inadvertedly rotate the Command Module into the gimbal lock zone.
127:10:53|They all know that IMU orientation based on Earth-Sun marking will not be as accurate as using stars for the purpose. However, they are aware that with the heavy constraints on their ability to maneuver as well as diffficulty spotting the stars, this should be adequate for the reentry and landing. Should the opportunity present itself, Jack can also try to look for the stars and perform a more nominal calibration using them.
127:11:42|This circuit breaker connects Battery Bus A to Main Bus A.
127:11:57|This connects Battery C to Main Bus B.
127:14:41|John Aaron has been working with the special team to produce these procedures, and they would be aware of such things.
127:15:24|The plan is to open the valve in the Command Module that allows them to vent the docking tunnel, and take the pressure down to be about 2 psia. While they do this, they can also monitor the CM cabin pressure for any signs of excessive leakage due to a badly fitting top hatch.
127:15:45|This opens the surge tank and will allow them to pressurize the Command Module with its own O<sub>2</sub> supply for the first time since they took shelter in the Command Module.
127:15:59|The main regulators supply the cabin with oxygen and maintain its pressure within the normal operational level of 5 psia.
127:16:20|The water and glycol systems are pressurized with the oxygen supply.
127:16:40|There are two emergency cabin pressure regulators, which start a high flow of oxygen into the cabin if the pressure drops suddenly.
127:16:55|The suit demand regulators supply O<sub>2</sub> into the spacesuit pressure circuit.
127:17:26|These circuit breakers supply power to the Environmental Control System sensors that monitor its condition for onboard display and for telemetry.
127:17:51|As before, but these power sensors that monitor temperatures in various subsystems and the spacecraft itself.
127:18:13|This sets up the glycol pump power supply to AC BUS 1.
127:19:11|The BMAGs needs to have power applied to them for some time before they are turned on properly, to condition the electronics to operational status.
127:19:35|This procedure from the Guidance and Navigation Checklist gives the instructions on getting the Stabilization Control System back online.
127:19:58|The suit compressor circulates the onboard atmosphere through the suit circuit for CO<sub>2</sub> scrubbing and temperature and humidity control. This step is to select AC BUS 1 as its power source.
127:20:20|After the SCS startup, they can now select SCS as the system responsible for attitude control. The CM would then have an active attitude control system.
127:20:42|The MANUAL ATTITUDE switches determine what kind of firing commands are sent to the RCS jets when the hand controllers are used.
127:21:01|Pressing the GDC ALIGN button will transfer their guidance platform status information into the Gyro Display Coupler, which uses the BMAGs as a backup to the IMU for attitude determination. With a brand new IMU alignment, this should give them a good BMAG orientation as well.
127:21:52|Jack notes that the power source selection will do little, unless they close the associated circuit breakers. These will enable the RHC power on DIRECT control mode.
127:23:07|Program 47 is the Command Module thrust Monitor, and will display the acceleration experienced on all three axes - X,Y,Z- on the DSKY. It will be useful for them to know how much, if any change in velocity the LM jettison might impart on the Command Module.
127:23:43|Since by this point the radio should be operational, Mission Control will be able to take part in the procedure by giving their approval.
127:23:59|These two switches fire the pyrotechnics that separate the entire docking ring from from the Command Module, letting it go along with the LM.
127:24:28|The sequential systems are secured once again once the LM separation has occurred.
127:25:25|MINIMUM IMPULSE will use very small bursts of RCS fire, saving fuel and keeping them steady.
127:26:11|By knowing a star that will be visible at the sextant when viewed at the entry attitude and at a particular time, they will know that the spacecraft has indeed attained this attitude.
127:26:52|Any proturberances on the surface of the Command Module generates additional friction and alters the airflow during the hardships of reenetry.
127:27:14|The sextant and the telescope have detachable eyepieces that were stored in a box on the top of the optics station. Having them come loose and hitting the crew or equipment would have been extremely dangerous. There was precendent, too - during the reentry of Apollo 12, the DAC 16mm film camera came loose and struck Alan Bean on the head.
127:28:12|Final updates will be made both over the radio to be written down as a PAD, and then also by uploading Mission Control's best tracking-based position data directly into the computer.
127:30:21|The Moon will provide them with a simple visual reference to ensure their entry attitude is correct, by having it line up with a degree line painted onto their hatch window.
127:30:49|They will start powering up the second BMAG gyroscope.
127:31:13|Once the LM is gone, their sole oxygen supply will be in the surge tank and the repress package within the Command Module. There should be ample oxygen to get them down, and even with no oxygen left in the tanks, the Command Module is rated to support them for one hour until the oxygen inside runs out and the air becomes dangerously saturated with carbon dioxide.
127:31:44|These breakers control power to the dump line heaters.
127:32:40|The suit compressor consumes 2 amps of power, and would be drain on their battery power supply. Should the air show signs of becoming dangerously saturated with carbon dioxide, they will be able to spare power for the compressor, however.
127:32:57|The Sequential Logic system will be used during reentry to release their various parachutes.
127:33:33|This powers the two FDAI 8-balls on the Main Display Console.
127:34:20|Jack is briefly concerned that they will be powering up much of the onboard electronics without having the coolant system online. Ken doesn't think it will be a problem, with the relatively small amount of heat generated, plus the Command Module being very cold and taing time to warm up.
127:35:04|On the bottom of page 2-2, they are able to start using the normal entry procedures checklists as basis for their actions, with a few modifications to the timeline and events. Here they would start Program 61 in the computer, to begin the reentry calculations.
127:37:14|VHF radio and tape recorder procedures are deleted, to save power.
127:38:33|The Sequential Systems check won't be done, since they've been using it earlier in the timeline. The maneuver at the end of the page is unnecessary info on the checklist, since they've been given a new procedure.
127:39:05|This page of the Entry checklist is only modified to change the time when the procedures are performed. The sextant star check involves them looking at a star specified by their entry PAD, to confirm their attitude.
127:40:21|The Command Module 16mm film camera needs DC power from the CM via a utility cable, hence they don't want to spend that power.
127:40:34|A reminder is added to not to initialize the EMS, since they will turn it off briefly again to save power.
127:42:34|They are to consult the CM RCS procedures on this page earlier as well, but change the timeline again to correspond with their special circumstances. Another reminder is added to not to put the optics eye pieces away at this point, since they will be needed still.
127:42:38|These battery procedures are struck off since they are included in their new checklist as well, rather than here.
127:44:54|They open circuit breakers that would have supplied RCS and the SPS in the defunct Service Module.
127:45:44|More timeline amendments are added here.
127:47:50|The superfluous systems checks are deleted, and the horizon check altered to the newly envisioned Moon check.
127:51:07|Service Module separation procedures will be performed per the new checklist, and the prexisting ones are deleted.
127:52:00|The timeline is altered again, to fit their new mission plan.
127:52:42|This is to turn off the telemetry system once the signal is lost, to spare the power they would spend transmitting out to nowhere.
127:55:23|The main alteration to the Stabilization Control System activation is that they will be using only one FDAI for the time being.
128:01:40|Only 239.3 pounds of SPS propellant consumed in the first midcourse correction, leaving them to haul 40,527.7 pounds with them back to Earth.
128:01:40|286 pounds out of the 1,342.8 pounds of RCS propellant loaded for the mission was consumed before RCS shutdown in the Service Module.
128:13:15|They plan to leave the docking tunnel partially pressurized and use the remaining air there to give the LM a burst of acceleration through the sudden decompression.
|The crew of Apollo 13 has just spent a number of hours receiving and writing down the reactivation checklist that is to be used to bring the Command Module <i>Odyssey</i> back to life after several days of cold, powerless hibernation. They have recharged the reentry batteries and have made plans for stowing their equipment for the landing. Everything is still looking good, and the crew is holding on, but the extreme stress and lack of rest, proper meals and adequate water is starting to show its toll.
128:24:21|Fred sounds puzzled by the request. The docking index was reported to Mission Control early on in the mission, and is not expected to change.
128:26:41|This checklist will be the Lunar Module side of the reentry preparations, performed simultaneously with the Command Module procedures.
128:29:44|The maneuver will be performed by the LM.
128:30:04|The LM's attitude control will be set to maximum deadband - which allows for more motion awawy from the one maintained at the moment - and to use pulse mode, for very short firings of the RCS jets.
128:30:22|Should the brief firing of the Command Module thrusters cause them to veer away from their desired attitude, the LM will then maneuver back.
128:30:25|MODE CONTROL sets for automatic attitude control under either the computer or the AGS.
128:31:42|This switch selects whether paired or single RCS jets are used for controlling pitch and roll.
128:32:11|In this step, they input four commands into the DEDA to program the AGS. The first three settings will set up the AGS to sense their acceleration on all three axes, and then the selection of address 470 will display the acceleration on the X axis, ie. in the direction of travel.
128:32:30|This is to change their velocity by half a foot.
128:33:25|Once the Service Module has been separated, Fred will use the RCS jets to return to their previous velocity.
128:34:30|Next step will be moving the Lunar Module to try and photograph the damage to the Service Module.
128:41:52|All six LM batteries should be online at this point.
128:43:10|These steps in the Command Module remove power from the umbilicals connecting the two spacecraft.
128:43:55|These breakers allow the two main buses in the LM to be connected together.
128:44:40|This opens the crosstie battery feeds.
128:49:45|This long litany resets and then reconnects the batteries to the buses.
128:53:12|This refers to Command Module's attitude control selection switch.
128:54:49|This comm configuration selects PM mode for the radio, Primary transceiver, primary power amplifier, VOICE OFF, telemetry on, ranging off, and high bit rate. Vance listed the choices in the order the comm selection switches are arranged in the console.
128:56:01|Next comes the configuration for the Environmental Control System. It will have little to do in terms of life support once the crew is gone, but will maintain operational temperature of the equipment until the end.
128:56:21|CLOSE setting on the dump valve prevents onboard atmosphere from being vented out even if the pressure rises beyond the normal limit. During typical operations, this valve would be used to depressurize the cabin while on the lunar surface.
128:56:46|In AUTO mode, the suit circuit will be relieved into the cabin if the pressure rises too high.
128:57:18|This closes the valve that allows cabin air to flow into the suit circuit for replenishment.
128:57:32|This prevents the suit circuit air from flowing into the cabin.
128:57:51|These close the oxygen flow into the suit hoses.
128:58:13|This stops all oxygen flow into the suit circuit.
128:58:31|Closing the repress valve prevents oxygen flow into the cabin.
128:58:35|Finally, they turn off the suit fan.
128:59:10|Although Jim was ostensibly resting, he has been roused by the continous radio chatter and the VOX Fred turned on earlier picks up his outburst, heard muffled and not meant for Mission Control to hear.
128:59:15|Vance tries to be as diplomatic as possible, and implies that the astronaut boss Deke Slayton has already given his word on the matter.
129:00:37|This pulls power from the automatic cabin repress system.
129:00:56|This valve is in the docking hatch into the tunnel that leads to the Command Module.
129:08:26|They add a few circuit breakers with the invention of providing more telemetry data from the LM after they separate.
129:08:43|After his earlier outburst, Lovell has now come on the line to speak his mind directly to Mission Control.
129:09:45|The arrival of the Astronaut Office boss Tom Stafford has made Jim sound more diplomatic than before.
129:10:20|Deke Slayton returns to the airwaves to deliver a joke that the editing team has not been able to decipher.
129:10:20|Lovell's outburst was dramatized for the Apollo 13 movie. The movie adaptation could even be called somewhat toned down, surprisingly enough, consisting of a brief monologue from Lovell about demanding the procedures to be ready sooner rather than later.
129:31:38|IVT stands for Intravehicular Transfer and is NASA lingo for "moving from on spaceship to another".
129:40:32|Distance is now 138,715 km, speed, 2,133 m/s.
129:40:32|Distance, 132,387 km, speed 2,192 m/s.
129:40:32|distance, 127,523 km, speed, 2,239 m/s.
|Only 10 hours remain to the splashdown of Apollo 13. The crew has received all the instructions needed for recovering their Command Module Odyssey, plus instructions on Lunar Module separation, required to be ejected before the crew's return to Earth in the heatshield-protected Command Module. Although the LM still serves fine as their shelter,, the crew is starting to show signs of the extreme fatigue caused by their situation. Everyone is trying to catch some rest now, for the duress of the reentry.
|Distance to go, 123,336 km, velocity, 2,286 m/s.
132:28:54|Undiscussed on the air to ground radio loop, Fred is feeling worse for wear. He has developed a urinary tract infection as a result of insufficient water intake.
132:28:54|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Fred woke up with chills before we did midcourse correction 7.&quot;
132:28:54|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Yes. I wasn't sure what gave me the chills. I was back in the CM at about that time, and I had to go to the bathroom. I stripped naked in the 42 degree temperature ricocheted around touching bare metal, and it just chilled me to the bone every time I'd touch anything. You can't help but bounce all around in there. I was really cold for the next 4 hours. From that time on, it sort of began to catch up with me. I began to feel tired. Before that, I really didn't feel much effect at all.&quot;
132:29:15|They are passing the MSFN duty from the station in Goldstone, California to Honeysuckle in Australia, leading to a momentary break in communications.
132:30:30|Once again, the radio system is reconfigured to support the ranging.
132:36:34|Mission Control wants a look at the erasable memory before the computer update, and will require a VERB 74 to downlink the contents of the memory.
132:39:05|The final midcourse correction will be so small that using the RCS jets will be the best way to go at it, rather than the DPS.
132:47:17|What Lousma is probably saying here is that without the dump valves active, the cabin pressure might rise unexpectedly due to no longer having the capacity to automatically vent excess pressure.
132:49:18|The confusing order to disable the EPS telemetry monitoring is removed.
132:51:32|Jim has returned to the airwaves with a further demand that their workload has to be managed, and not cluttered with last minute changes.
132:52:43|Deke's suggestion of not working too hard on the platform alignment might be an offer to reduce their workload, but might not be what the perfectionist crewmembers want to hear, even under the current circumstances.
132:52:50|It is well known to Mission Control that the crew has not been sleeping properly ever since the accident. It is a great concern to them that they might be getting too exhausted to properly work through the improvised reentry procedures. Hence comes the suggestion via Deke that they should take some of the dextroamphetamine stimulant tablets stored in the medical kit.
132:53:46|Dehydrated coffee would've been carried, but made with the cold water they have available, it surely wouldn't have the moral-raising effect of the hot beverage suggested by Deke Slayton.
132:54:19|Distance to go is 111,581 km , their velocity is up to 2,408 m/s. In the hour and 7 minutes since the last PAO update, they have travelled 12,000 km and accelerated a further 122 m/s.
132:54:19|LM temperature is around 12 degrees Celsius.
133:23:52|To relieve the crew's miserable conditions, the GO has been given to start up the LM early. Having active equipment will warm up the cabin and give the crew a couple more comfortable hours before reentry.
133:35:11|The crew has proceeded with their powerup and tripled their power usage.
133:38:26|'Downlink 2' refers to their present communications configuration, which includes the ranging on as present.
133:41:32|Without the RCS thrusters powered, they won't be able to rectify their drift towards a possible gimbal lock situation.
133:44:56|The RCS thruster quads measure from 48 to 56 degrees Celsius.
133:48:07|Jim is probably referring to them having no inertial reference going.
133:55:54|'Charlie' is not a person but military lingo for 'clear' or 'confirmed'.
133:57:26|The Abort Guidance System AGS' gyroscopes and accelerometers in the ASA (Abort Sensor Assembly) have reached operational temperature.
134:02:59|Their unusual configuration resulted in Jim and Fred having to learn a new way to fly the spacecraft stack, and soon he will have to try to revert to the official way of going at it once the Service Module is gone.
134:06:25|Their SUIT TEMP has been sitting on COLD for quite some time, to try and make the cabin warmer by having the cooling system remove less heat from the spacecraft. Now that they are powering up the systems, the system is working in a more normal manner and they ought to adjust the temperature control to its usual position to raise the temperature.
134:11:18|Although Mission Control had not planned to bring up the LM's computer up again, the opportunity has presented itself. By taking sightings of the Moon and the Sun, they can coarse align the IMU to a known inertial orientation (in a Program 51 alignment) and then proceed to a 52 for the fine alignment.
134:23:54|The familiar updata power supply has to be turned on before they can receive the computer update.
134:28:16|They're hitting the switch to allow Mission Control upload data into their newly restarted LGC.
134:39:46|Option 1 is the "Preferred" alignment option and will take their then-present attitude and use it was an attitude reference. Taking sightings of the Sun and the Moon will help them to refine the alignment.
134:39:46|The cabin temperature is from 12.2 to 13.3 degrees Celsius, and just a little more comfortable than earlier.
135:04:28|NOUN 05 displays the angular differences, or the degree that the gimbals have to be torqued to get the IMU to the best possible alignment.
135:10:55|Jim proceeds to use star sightings to check the accuracy of their alignment. By having the computer try and point them at the stars in question, they will find out if the platform is good.
135:10:55|Distance, 94,276 km, velocity 2,643 m/s.
135:17:43|VERB 74 performs the erasable memory dump, to allow Mission Control to read the contents of the LGC's memory.
135:23:52|Switching the power amplifier to HIGH will attempt to maintain radio signal with recovery forces for as long as possible.
135:23:52|Distance, 91,816 km, velocity, 2,679 m/s.
135:33:22|The crew has been joking that using the primary guidance system means 'going first class'. Since they unexpectedly have PGNS running, they can use primary guidance for attitude control.
135:35:52|One of RCS breakers was broken beore launch. The permanently closed circuit breaker is still, indeed, closed.
135:35:52|Distance to go, 90, 418 km. Velocity, 2,701 m/s.
135:42:02|The sudden availability of the LM's guidance computer and the IMU has given them the opportunity to reverse the standard procedure of docked IMU alignment, where the Command Module supplies the LM's initial IMU alignment. Nothing prevents them from doing the same procedure the other way around, although the calculations will be somewhat different. As they say, this would be faster than doing the earlier alignment idea.
135:46:40|Both the crew and Mission Control are enthusiastic about their new faster way of aligning the Command Module's platform for reentry.
135:47:13|They're 88,900 km away and their velocity has climbed up to 2,743 m/s. About 7 hours to go.
135:47:38|Distance, 88, 633 km, velocity 2,730 m/s. The crew's improved mood can even be heard in the little jokes.
135:50:07|The procedure on page 7-1 would normally be used to realign the IMU using attitude information derived via the Gyro Display Coupler (or GDC) from the two BMAGs in the Command Module. The way they are planning to using it here, however, is to input values based on the alignment of the LM's IMU and then converted by Mission Control to be useful in the Command Module's different orientation. As noted by the crew, it is the reverse of the procedure to transfer guidance information from the CM to the LM, which was done during the entry into the lifeboat <i>Aquarius</i>.
135:53:18|Distance to go, 87,622, velocity, 2,736 m/s.
136:07:02|With the PGNS back in action for this burn, the PAD information returns to the original format used for LM crew maneuvers.
136:07:02|The PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> A midcourse correction to improve their entry corridor angle.<br> <b>Time of ignition (Noun 33):</b> 137 hours, 39 minutes, 48.39 seconds.<br> <b>Change in velocity, fps (m/s) (Noun 81):</b> x, -3.1 (-0.95 m/s); y, 0.0 (0 m/s); z, +0.1 (0.03 m/s). The change in velocity is resolved into three components which are quoted relative to the LVLH (Local Vertical/Local Horizontal).<br> <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> and <b>H<sub>P</sub></b> Apogee is not applicable, since this is a reentry trajectory. Perigee is 20.5 miles. (32.99 km) This brings the closest point of approach to the surface of the Earth within the atmosphere, which means that the trajectory reenters. <br> <b>Delta-V<sub>R</sub>:</b> 3.1 fps (-0.94 m/s). This is the total resultant change in velocity the spacecraft would experience and is a vector sum of the three components given above.<br> <b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 23 seconds.<br> <b>Spacecraft attitude:</b> Roll, 0008&deg;; Pitch, 359&deg;. The desired spacecraft attitude is measured relative to the alignment of the guidance platform and is therefore set using the FDAI display in its inertial mode. Unlike a CSM PAD, yaw is not stated for the LM. Procedures for a lunar landing allowed the spacecraft to yaw around the thrust axis as required for operational reasons.
136:07:02|Other notes include that this burn will be performed using the LM RCS +X thrusters, a four-jet ullage, and DAP with the weights of the docked spacecraft specified. Guidance will be on PGNS and the IMU with AGS backup.
136:09:54|This is the push-pull maneuver, which will change their velocity briefly and put a little bit of distance between the two components.
136:10:48|This understated exchange signifies an important mark - Swigert has moved into the Odyssey to start the power up according to the reentry checklist. His first duty will be to configure tpart of the power system and start the RCS thruster heating.
136:14:23|It is important to know the Command Module's gimbal angles, since their platform will be functional at the time of the separation, and risks gimbal lock if the middle gimbal angle goes past 90 degrees.
136:17:04|Distance, 83,812, velocity, 2,811 m/s.
136:19:01|Jim refers to using the automatic maneuver to get to the separation attitude.
136:20:20|Jack is powering up the onboard sensor equipment, but is having trouble with his own penmanship.
136:22:12|Distance, 82,220 km, velocity, 2,838 m/s.
136:42:51|Because only one half of the thrusters can be heated using power from the LM umbilical, the rest are heated using power from Battery A. The dropping voltage means that the current is growing.
136:47:12|Joe is reminding the crew to use Program 41 in the Lunar Module computer, which is the RCS Burn program. Their previous PGNS-controlled DPS burns were performed using Program 40.
136:47:12|Distance, 78,893 km, velocity, 2,900 m/s.
137:05:22|Inputting <b>400 + 3000</b> into the DEDA will have the AGS align its own inertial reference to the IMU.
137:07:07|The temperatures are read from the Systems Test Meter, and they range from + 22&deg;F to +34&deg;F, or -5.5 &deg;C to 1.1 &deg;C.
137:09:13|Inputting <b> 400 +50000</b> into the DEDA aligns the AGS' inertial reference to the body axes of the LM. Inputting <b>400 +00000</b> sets up the AGS attitude hold.
137:15:08|Distance, 74.230 km, speed, 2,991 m/s.
137:17:39|Distance, 73,404 km.
137:17:39|Ronald Evans joined NASA in Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He had so far worked in the support crew for Apollo 7 and Apollo 11 and as a CapCom for Apollos 7, 9 and 11. He was the backup CMP for Apollo 14. He would be the CMP for Apollo 17 in 1972.
137:24:56|Distance, 72,610 km, speed, 3,026 m/s.
137:27:00|AVERAGE G is a routine in the computer which calculates the state vector during powered flight, updating it every two seconds.
137:29:46|Despite planning the maneuver using PGNS computer guidance, the crew has elected to use the AGS instead.
137:29:46|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;We finally got our rough alignment for midcourse correction 7. Houston called up and asked if we would like to do a PGNS burn, and we said "Fine." That's where I really got confused. I guess Dr. Berry thought I was tired. Well, maybe I was tired.&quot;
137:29:46|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I really preferred to do the old AGS burn again, because we had done it one time and I knew that it worked. But, this burn was okay. We burned RCS this time.&quot;
137:29:46|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;That ended up being an AGS burn, Jim.&quot;
137:29:46|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Yes, Houston finally told us to go to the AGS.&quot;
137:30:05|Their distance is 71,672 km, velocity 3,045 m/s.
137:30:56|Distance, 70,937 km, speed, 3,062 m/s.
137:37:14|These set up the AGS to monitor their acceleration for the burn, and then display it on the DEDA.
|The pace of crucial events is definitely ramping up onboard the still docked stack of Apollo 13. The LM's RCS jets were used to perform a final nudge on their trajectory to ensure safe return. Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert has applied electric power to the RCS jets in the Command Module Odyssey in what is one of the first duties he has to perform in the newly awakening spacecraft. As long as everything works according to the plan, they should have as good a chance of returning home safely as any Apollo crew so far. To get there, they will have to accomplish many unusual milestones, however, the first which is coming very soon in the form of separating the damaged Service Module while still a considerable way away from reentry.
137:41:30|Distance, 18,776 km, velocity 3,090 m/s.
137:44:08|Program 41 is used to calculate and control RCS maneuvers, such as the one just performed. Since the crew opted to use AGS for controlling the burn, it served only as a display for the maneuver.
137:47:55|Deke is reminding the crew of his earlier suggestion that they should pep themselves up with the dextroamphetamines. The Crew Technical Debriefing had some crew comments on this and their other medication use.
137:47:55|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;The medical kits were adequate. We used aspirin.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I used two Lomotils ad one Dexedrine.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I used Dexedrine and we also used quite a bit of aspirin and one Darvon.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;You used two Lomotils?&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;They didn't do any good.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Are you sure you got the right compartment?&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I think so.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;And we used seasickness pills.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;No you didn't.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I took the Marezine.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Dexedrine.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I took a Dexedrine.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I just took one Dexedrine.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I didn't take any because the seasickness pills had that in it.&quot;
137:47:55|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Yes. I was a bit concerned about taking too much Dexedrine. I was afraid it might wear off before I got down.&quot;
137:47:55|Fred wondering about whether Jack found the right tablets is a genuine worry. The medical kit was extremely compact and sometimes it was hard to find the correct medication. It is recorded that Gene Cernan accidentally took one of the anti-motion sickness dextroamphetamine/scopolamine tablets while trying to take an anti-flatulence tablet during Apollo 17.
137:47:55|All the crewmembers would be familiar with the effects of the stimulants. Pre-mission medical testing included the crew taking all the drugs carried onboard to see if any adverse effects would develop.
137:47:55|Distance to go, 68,467 km and closing in fast.
137:50:43|Distance to go, 67,813 km. They have traveled over 600 km in four minutes or so.
137:57:11|The LM RCS' fuel supply is approaching a point where they are no longer able to measure the amount left accurately, and want to be sure that they have enough for the final stretch.
138:00:59|Shucking off the Service Module will drop their mass considerably, hence the Digital Autopilot will have to be reprogrammed to take this into account.
138:00:59|Distance, 66,107 km celocity is 3,170 m/s and rising.
138:02:09|To jettison the Service Module, they've opened the guards on CM/SM SEP 1 and 2 switches and energized them.
138:02:09|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;When we got to the point to jettison the SM, I thrusted up. Then, Fred went to verify that Jack was going to throw the right switch.&quot;
138:02:09|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I wanted Fred there to make sure that I raised the CM/SM SEP switch and not the CM/LM SEP switches.&quot;
138:02:09|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I did go, but he had gray tape over the LM SEP switches. I figured that was enough of a safeguard and the way Jim thrusted, I needed to be there to control the pitch again with the TTCA.&quot;
138:02:09|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;You should have seen Fred when we got back there. I was all ready to go; I had the logic up and I was ready for pyro arm. Fred said he would get a GO from MSFN. Then I reminded him that we didn't have any telemetry and MSFN couldn't give us a GO. When I asked if he was ready, he looked at me with a wistful sigh, as if, "Well, go ahead." I put power up, and I could hear the relays clicking.&quot;
138:02:09|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;We debated putting the hatches on, but we thought we might as well go all the way.&quot;
138:02:09|Hitting the CSM SEP switches energizes the sequential systems, and the automatic separation procedure begins. To safely remove the two spacecraft from one another, the electric cabling is cut with a pyrotechnic guillotine device. A small explosive charge is used to power the guillotine that deadfaces the connections and locks into place to stop them from accidentally reconnecting.
138:02:09|Once the electric connections are cut, another explosive guillotine separates the Service Module Umbilical from the Command Module.
138:02:09|Finally, three shaped charges cut the tension ties that hold the Service and Command Modules together, and create a spring action that pushes the Command Module away. In a normal separation sequence, electronics boxes inside the Service Module would now command the Service Module RCS jets to fire until fuel depletion, to put as much distance between the two modules as possible. With the special situation of Apollo 13, the Service Module is completely inert, and the LM RCS jets are used for a manual maneuver to first separate them, then to turn around in a manner that allows them to observe the Service Module.
138:04:26|AVERAGE G is a computer routine that calculates their acceleration during powered flight, ie. when a thrust maneuver is performed. To terminate it, they have to key in VERB 37 ENTER 00 ENTER to put the computer to idle or Program 00, 'P00' mode.
138:06:25|Distance to go, 65,190 km.
138:10:47|Their moment of shocked reflection is soon gone, interrupted by the need to get back to business.
|Apollo 13's long return home is almost over. With four and a half hours to go before their expected splashdown, the time to return to Command Module <i>Odyssey</i> is at hand. They have just released the Service Module and witnessed the evidence of the near complete destruction of the module caused by the oxygen tank explosion.
138:13:40|NOUN 46 sets up their DAP program as 31021 - docked configuration, 2 jets on RCS system B, fine scale (4 degrees/s) large deadband (5 degrees) and .5 degrees rate. NOUN 47 gives the weights of the Command Module and the Lunar Module in pounds. With the Service Module gone, the computer needs to readjust its firing commands based on the new weight distribution and center of gravity in the docked stack.
138:14:53|As NASA and government official file in to wait for the splashdown, the ship is speeding 63,616 km away from Earth, and moving at 3,233 m/s.
138:16:13|Jack has now powered the Command Module Computer, as per their reactivation checklist.
138:16:35|Remarkably, the computer's warning lights are not powered, while the computer is already running. This spares a little bit of power by not needing the AC inverter on yet.
138:16:55|It sounds like Jack has tried the procedure on both at his station at the controls and at the Lower Equipment Bay, where the second DSKY is located by the optics.
138:19:56|Jack is talking about VERB 50 NOUN 25, option 00062, which should put the computer into the standby mode.
138:24:34|Distance to go, 61,799 km, velocity, 3,279 m/s.
138:31:37|It appears that they are drawing just a little too much power to their liking, and want Jack to see if the Command Module is configured as per the checklist.
138:37:11|Main A is already powered from the Command Module's own batteries, while Main B still receives power via the umbilicals from the Lunar Module. They obviously want to save all of the CM battery power now that they still can do so.
138:39:11|The Command Module's RCS jets are the prime suspect for the moment as the source of their power drain. Turning them off didn't improve the situation, however.
138:43:46|The entry PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> Reentry from transearth trajectory<br> <b>Landing target:</b> The landing target is the Mid-Pacific Landing Area, which is their primary recovery area.<br> <b>IMU gimbal angles required for trim at 0.05g:</b> Roll, 000&deg;; pitch, 153&deg;; yaw, 000&deg;.<br> <b>Time of the Moon check:</b> 142 hours, 38 minutes, 17 seconds GET.<br> <b>Spacecraft pitch at Moon check:</b> 178&deg;. <br> <b>Estimated Splashdown point:</b> minus 21.66&deg; latitude, minus 165.37&deg; longitude.<br> <b>Maximum number of g's during entry:</b> 6.7.<br> <b>Velocity at Entry Interface (400,000 feet altitude):</b> 36,211 feet/second ( meters/second).<br> <b>Entry flight path angle at Entry Interface:</b> 6.51&deg;.<br> <b>Range to go to splashdown point from 0.05g event:</b> 1,168.9 nautical miles.

Constant g entry is performed by maintaining roll to right.
138:46:33|A most interesting note Kerwin makes in his report is the mention of the "constant g backup reentry area'. This is a theoretical target point for a landing made with a very rudimentary backup reentry procedure, where the crew will use only the accelerometer data to perform a manual landing. By maintaining constant g - approximately 4 g's, they are sure to decelerate the Command Module enough for it to slow down and then plunge towards the sea and coming to a landing there. This should be performed only if the computer guidance or the backup landing maneuver using the Entry Monitoring System (EMS) should both fail.
138:47:46|The Summer Triangle refers to a triangular pattern on the star field where the points are formed by Vega, Deneb and Altair, respectively, all Apollo navigation stars and hence a good target for their sightings.
138:54:19|Their voltage is nominal. They're doing good after removing some potential ghost loads.
138:54:19|Distance: 55,978 km, velocity: 3,441 m/s.
138:59:41|Their earlier advice on how to spot stars with the Command Module optics will not apply if they remain in the new attitude as suggested by Jim.
139:14:30|Mission Control has the ability to visualize what stars are visible in the optics at any given time and spacecraft orientation, allowing them to provide this information with almost no delay.
139:15:48|One of the LM batteries has finally been drained almost completely, and they are switching it off after approximately 76 hours of service. Plenty of power still remains, especially in the Ascent Stage batteries they've been saving up.
139:17:30|Cone Crater is a landmark at their Fra Mauro landing area.
139:17:44|Distance to go, 51,297 km, velocity is up to 3,590 m/s.
139:21:46|Jim thinks they aren't able to see any stars for the moment, hence requiring to use gimbal angles computed at Mission Countrol to start aligning the IMU.
139:24:18|PICAPAR is a computer routine that will select suitable stars within the optics' field of vision for the purpose of navigational sightings. Having them within the field of vision saves up RCS fuel, for not having to rotate the spacecraft around to find more stars to look at.
139:24:53|Should their star sightings fail, there is a plan to use the still-attached LM to turn the Command Module's optics to face the Moon and the Sun and use them for navigational reference.
139:31:33|Noun 20 (PRESENT ICDU ANGLES R,P,Y) will display the gimbal angles on the Lunar Module DSKY. Mission Control will use this information to calculate the corresponding angles in the Command Module's reference system.
139:36:15|It sounds like that the rapidly changing procedures and the tiredness are catching up to Jim - besides the poor radio signal - and he has to ask for repetition.
139:37:48|If everything else fails, they will adjust the IMU to a pre-set orientation designated for the entry, with the guidance X-axis aligned to the local horizontal plane.
139:37:48|Distance, 46,720 km, velocity, 3,751 m/s.
139:52:21|These values will be used to set the initial state of the IMU platform to correspond with their present attitude.
139:52:21|Distance to go, 44,212 km.
139:52:21|Distance to go, 42,959 km, velocity up to 12,798. Their velocity at Entry Interface, or first contact with the upper reaches of the atmosphere will happen at 11,037 m/s.
140:11:20|The LM power transfer has been terminated, and from now on the Command Module relies on its batteries only.
140:16:33|The Command Module's telecommunications have come back online, and they are using the four alphabetically named OMNI antennas once more.
140:16:33|Distance, 39,062 km.
140:23:24|Distance to go, 37,516, velocity, 4,152 m/s.
140:27:56|They are now uploading crucial data into the computer's erasable memory that they will need to set up their guidance system after several days of freeze.
140:35:53|Distance to go, 34,490 km, velocity is up to 4,311 m/s.
140:44:26|Jack's DSKY is showing him Alarm 00220, "IMU orientation unknown." Although he has started setting up the IMU platform, the computer doesn't know this yet.
140:45:15|The 'flags' are yes/no data points in the computer, which will tell the navigational programming the status of a particular value. The drift flag refers to the amount of drift from optimal accuracy the gyroscopes have degraded since launch - something that can be compensated for via the computer's program. The REFSMMAT flag tells the computer whether the IMU has a known alignment or not.
140:45:15|Distance, 32,338, velocity up to 4,435 m/s.
140:45:15|Distance, 31,900, velocity, 4,459 m/s.
140:49:36|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;The two stars were Altair or Vega. At that time, Jim was saying to hurry up because the Earth was getting bigger. He was chomping to get out of the LM.&quot;
140:49:53|Jack is now pushing on with the P52 IMU alignment, trying to sight stars he can use for navigational measurements. This would provide them with the most accurate guidance platform, although they are ready to go with the more crude Sun-Moon alignment, if he can't see the stars. Having just separated from the Service Module, however, debris from that is apparently visible in the optics and hampering his visibility.
|The splashdown for Apollo 13 is two hours away. The damaged Service Module is gone, and the long dormant <i>Odyssey</i> is slowly showing signs of life as they work to reestablish attitude control and navigation systems. Very soon it will be time to separate from their long-serving lifeboat.
140:52:22|The helium pressure in the Command Module RCS is more than sufficient.
140:52:46|Much to everyone's delight, Jack's star measurements appear to be successful.
140:53:05|Jack proceeds with the fine alignment of the IMU platform by torquing the gimbals, much like he has done at every P52 throughout the mission, but none have been performed under such extraordinary circumstances.
140:54:28|This was the eighth realignment of the Command Module guidance platform, and Jack's seventh and final P52. As a reference, he sighted on star 36 Vega (Alpha Lyrae) and star 40 Altair (Alpha Aquilae). The star angle difference measured was 'all ball's or '00000' on the display, meaning that his final, hurried P52 was one of perfect accuracy within the limits of the system. He performed a sighting of a another star to check the alignment but this star is not recorded in the Mission Report. Finally, he torqued the gimbals to correct fine alignment. The angles were were -1.253&deg; in X, 0.365&deg; in Y and 3.263&deg; in Z. The platform was torqued at 140:52:00 GET. This aligns their IMU to the ENTRY REFSMMAT.
140:57:56|Apollo is coming in close now at 29,235 kilometers from Earth, and speeding up to 4,630 m/s.
141:00:32|The final DAP configuration is Docked, 2 Jet/RCS A, fine scale, 5-degree deadband, and .5-degree rate.
141:01:54|The optics draw 3.1 amps of power, not an inconsiderable amount under the circumstances.
141:02:15|Ring 1 temperature is 10 &deg;C, while Ring 2 shows 5.6 &deg;C.
141:06:18|Distance, 26,795 km.
141:06:18|Their distance is 25,965 km, and closing very fast. They approximate a distance of 18,000 km at the time of LM separation.
141:12:42|They have closed the hatch into the LM. A warning light has come up, alerting the crew that oxygen is flowing out of the CM's own supply at an unusually high rate.
141:13:37|A valve on Jack's left hand console allows him to flow in oxygen into the cabin under manual control. This valve is not the reason for their alarm, though.
141:13:43|With the CM top hatch closed, their life support system needs to take over the full responsibility for maintaining the cabin atmosphere. It appeared to them from the instruments that the oxygen flow was higher than expected. They don't find it a problem, instead thinking that the system is making up for any difference it detects.
141:15:32|Joe's expressing worry that the Lunar Module, now left to its own devices under autopilot control, might accidentally move the Command Module to an attitude that threatens them with the gimbal lock.
141:15:46|Distance, 24,600 km, velocity, 4,983 m/s.
141:18:47|The BMAGs will not only provide them with attitude information for their FDAI 8-ball display to support the info provided by the computer, but will also take over as the main source of attitude data should the IMU suddenly fail.
141:20:59|Distance to go, 23,102 km, speed, 5,109 m/s.
141:22:29|Since the FDAI's draw the rate information from the BMAGs, turning the BMAGs on while the FDAI's are working might cause them to give false information.
141:22:55|It appears the crew has put on their biomedical harnesses again and plugged them in to send the biotelemetry to Houston for the rest of the mission, after having removed them earlier during the coast.
141:22:55|Distance to go is 22,343 km speed, 5,178 m/s.
141:26:43|Distance, 21,465 km.
141:30:24|Joe's warning is not without cause. Their maneuvering has put them perilously close to the state that would make them lose their brand new guidance reference.
141:30:24|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;On the CM/LM SEP, the LM moved smartly away and the noise didn't appear to be excessive. Immediately, I noticed a pitchup in the CM about the same time that Jim called a GIMBAL LOCK. We were sitting right near the gimbal lock limits, and he had a GIMBAL LOCK light on the DSKY status lights. I pitched down, using the DIRECT RCS switches. I came off then with the three MANUAL ATTITUDE switches. We did get out of the gimbal lock region and stabilized. All the time I noticed a continual pitchup rate. However minor, it would definitely affect the attitudes, continually pitched up. We went from the separation attitude down to the entry attitude, and Jim performed the sextant star check. Our maneuver from that was to the Moon-check attitude, and we maintained this attitude in a kind of wide deadband fashion until our Moon-check time.&quot;
141:30:24|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Maybe it was because of your being busy with the test , whereas I was just an innocent bystander sitting over there , but the LM SEP impressed me as being the loudest pyro event that I heard from stem to stern during the mission.&quot;
141:30:24|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;It was encouraging, I know.&quot;
141:30:24|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;It was very close, and it impressed the heck out of me, I know. It actually rocked me off my seat toward the window when it let go.&quot;
141:30:24|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I didn't notice that, perhaps because I had both hands at the controls.&quot;
|The splashdown of Apollo 13 is only a little over an hour away, and the spacecraft is now down to the final component that remains, the Command Module. The damaged Service Module is gone, as is the Lunar Module <i>Aquarius</i> that supported them diligently all the way back from the Moon. The tired crew of Apollo 13, and the equally exhausted men in Mission Control have done everything they can to ensure that the crew can make a safe return. The math says the batteries will last all the way to landing. Their trajectory is solid. Recovery forces are standing by in a global readiness to pick up the crew and render assistance to them. Families are wishing and hoping.
|Should the Command Module end up splashing down unexpectedly far away from the primary recovery ship, the long range rescue aircraft can drop down survival equipment to them, including a large sea anchor that will slow down the drift of the Command Module and make it easier reach by other recovery forces heading to its location.
141:37:20|The star check is one for the Entry PAD, with them sighting Antares through the optics.
141:38:46|17,970 kilometers to go, velocity, 5,640 m/s.
141:38:46|The distance to go is 16,856 km, and their speed is 5,776 m/s. With their ever-faster fall towards the Earth, they have travelled a thousand kilometers in four minutes, and gained 136 m/s in velocity.
141:47:00|To save power, they will make the rest of the way down without recycling the onboard atmosphere.
141:51:06|The data passed up for their very last entry PAD is interpreted as follows:<br> <b>Purpose:</b> Entry.<br> <b>Landing target:</b> Mid-Pacific, Primary Recovery Area<br> <b>IMU gimbal angles required for trim at 0.05g:</b> Roll, 000&deg;; pitch, 152&deg;; yaw, 000&deg;.<br> <b>Time of the horizon check:</b> 142 hours, 38 minutes, 19 seconds GET.<br> <b>Spacecraft pitch at horizon check:</b> 178&deg;. This will be a Moonset and moon-check <br> <b>Predicted splashdown point (Noun 61):</b> minus 21.66&deg; latitude, minus 165.37&deg; longitude.<br> <b>Maximum number of g's during entry:</b> 5.2.<br> <b>Velocity at Entry Interface (400,000 feet altitude):</b> 36,211 feet/second (meters/second).<br> <b>Entry flight path angle at Entry Interface:</b> 6.20&deg;.<br> <b>Range to go to splashdown point from 0.05g event:</b> 1,119.7 nautical miles. To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel from the 0.05 g event to landing. This figure will be decremented by the EMS based on signals from its own accelerometer.<br> <b>Predicted inertial velocity at 0.05g event:</b> 36,291 feet/second. This is another entry for the EMS. It is entered into the unit's Delta-V counter and will be decremented based on signals from its own accelerometer.<br> <b>Time of Entry Interface:</b> 142 hours, 40 minutes, 46 seconds GET.<br> <b>Time from Entry Interface to 0.05g event:</b> 0:30 (seconds).<br> <b>Planned drag level (deceleration) during the constant g phase:</b> 4.00g.<br> <b>Time from Entry Interface until their velocity slows sufficiently to allow a circular orbit around the Earth:</b> 02:20.<br> The practical implication of this is that this is the &quot;capture point&quot; where the CM will no longer be able to skip off the atmosphere.

Since the direction of the lift vector is towards the crew's feet, they will re-enter in a heads-down attitude.<br> <b>GDC align stars:</b> The stars to be used for GDC align purposes are 31 Arcturus and 33 Antares.

Constant g entry is performed by maintaining roll to right. Instructions have been given on powerdown should battery power become critical during reentry procedures.
141:51:12|Distance is now but 13,120 km, and their velocity is up to 6,331 m/s.
141:51:12|As the <i>Odysssey</i> approaches very close to Earth and then enters the atmosphere, they move below the line of sight of the radio and tracking stations, hence the ARIA aircraft are needed again to allow for maximum coverage at this very last phase of the mission.
141:51:12|Distance, 12,237 km velocity is 6,450 m/s.
142:01:04|To ensure that their guidance for the reentry is as accurate as possible, they update the state vector, the accelerometer data and the onboard clock.
142:01:50|Altitude, 10,856 km speed, 6,732 m/s.
142:07:10|With the minutes ticking down, they are now but 9,508 km away and moving at 7,017 m/s.
142:09:35|The power they estimate to remain in the batteries is incidentally very close to the amount that was transferred from the LM to the Command Module, meaning that without the battery charge, they would have most likely ended up running out.
142:09:35|With less than half an hour to go, they are now at 7,547 km away and speeding in at 7,504 m/s.
142:18:31|They decide not to use the suit compressors to recirculate the air, hence saving some power. They can make it down quite comfortably without, for now.
142:18:42|Distance, 6,491 km, velocity, 7,831 m/s.
142:20:21|Jack's comment confirms that they've started the computer-guided reentry sequence by choosing Program 61. One of its displays is Noun 60, which indicates the predicted maximum g forces experienced, the predicted velocity, and the entry angle. They will go through Programs 62 and 63 before the actual reentry, still.
142:21:21|Noun 63 displays the range to go from Entry Interface, the predicted velocity at the time, and the time from Entry Interface.
142:22:56|Battery C was the first one brought online, supporting the Command Module RCS heating and other Main Bus A loads while the rest of the systems were powered from the Lunar Module.
142:22:56|Their velocity is 8,398 m/s.
142:33:31|This could be a gentle jibe, or acknowledgment of the astronauts' famous aversity towards the medical profession.
142:34:04|A very cheeky Joe Kerwin suggests that the party could be improved by Jack Swigert passing along contact information to eligible guests. This is a clear reference to Swigert's infamous bachelor lifestyle, which was even mentioned by Jim Lovell in the Apollo mission history published later.
142:34:04|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">Apollo Expeditions to the Moon (NASA SP-350, 1975):</span></b> &quot;Only when we reached Honolulu did we comprehend our impact: there we found President Nixon and Dr. Paine to meet us, along with my wife, Marilyn, Fred's wife Mary (who, being pregnant, also had a doctor along just in case), and bachelor Jack's parents, in lieu of his usual airline stewardesses.&quot;
142:34:04|Although the PAO updates earlier mention many dignitaries and astronauts taking seats in the VIP viewing room overlooking Mission Control, it is the astronauts who have performed various crucial duties during the mission who have come into the Mission Control room itself. Wouldn't want to be anywhere else, surely.
142:38:45|The speed of the spacecraft entering the atmosphere causes a great deal of friction to form between the skin of the spacecraft and the surrounding air molecules. This friction converts the energy of their motion into heat. The gas molecules are heated up to a degree that they are ionized into plasma, which not only creates the plume of fire that will surround the spacecraft, but will also block radio waves and leave them outside radio contact for a few minutes.
142:38:45|As the comms blackout begins, they are just about to experience the 0.05g event - when the first hints of deceleration due to atmospheric re-entry occurs. It is at this point that the EMS display will either start automatically, or will be started manually by the crew (as is the case of Apollo 13's landing). From then on the EMS display, based on its own internal accelerometer, will use a moving plastic scroll to display their entry profile. The digital numeric display shows their velocity. This information could be used to make a manually controlled landing should the automatic computer guidance fail. This not being the case, they are now being flown by the computer running Program 64 "Entry post 0.05G".
142:38:45|The Entry Monitoring System should have started automatically at this point. Due to the .05g light not illuminating at the predicted moment, Jack hit the switch to start it up manually.
142:38:45|As they hit the Earth atmosphere, the Command Module undergoes deceleration as a result of the thickering air offering resistance to the fast-moving object that is the CM. The resulting friction generates the fearful heat that threatens to melt down the skin of the vessel falling from space. The heat is strongest at the so-called stagnation point.
142:38:45|The reentry is not merely a passive event where the capsule hurtles down from space and the crew holds on and hopes for the best. The main forces affecting their trajectory are the <b>drag</b> generated by them hitting the thickening air with a very high speed, as well as <b>lift</b> produced by the hull of the spacecraft acting as a lifting wing-like surface. With the center of gravity carefully positioned inside the spacecraft, the Command Module is designed to enter the atmosphere at a somewhat lopsided angle. This will create a proper drag to lift ratio, or the relationship between their deceleration, and the lift provided by the air flowing around them. This way, not only will the deceleration slow them down, but the lift will also carry the blunt capsule onto their desired destination. To manipulate this further, the Command Module RCS jets are fired either automatically by the CMC or manually by the crew while consulting the EMS for information on their decceleration and estimated speed and landing location. The RCS jets are used to rotate the spacecraft around its central X axis, thus generating changes in the drag and lift ratio. This allows them to manipulate their trajectory to a limited degree on all directions.
142:38:45|The EMS has an arrow-like display that indicates the needed lift vector for each situation. By manipulating the lift, the computer - or the crew if doing a manual re-entry, using the EMS as guidance - the Command Module's flight path through the atmosphere can be controlled. For instance, if they are coming in too steeply, the resulting high deceleration can cause intolerable g forces upon the crew and the spacecraft. By increasing lift, they can slow down the spacecraft while also making it fly further along, losing more speed in the process and giving a more gentle landing. The same way, a too shallow an angle could cause them to miss their landing site or even cause them to bounce off the top of the atmosphere and go for an extra circle around the Earth before losing enough speed to re-enter again. In such a situation, reducing the lift and increasing the drag is preferable. The guidance also gives them some crossrange capacity of moving their trajectory left and right, to help even further in aiming their landing spot.
142:38:45|A long Mylar plastic scroll is printed with the various entry patterns. Upon EMS start, motors start to move the scroll to provide a visual indication of the deceleration effects of their present attitude.
142:38:45|Ken Mattingly and John Young are prominent in this view of the astronauts waiting to hear from their comrades. CapCom Joe Kerwin has opted for a nervous puff on his pipe. Note the discarded CO<sub>2</sub> adapter prototype on the floor next to the console!
142:46:03|It has taken them longer than predicted to report in, only adding to the nervous waiting. The <i>Odyssey</i>'s unexpectedly shallow entry angle made the blackout period last longer than thought.
142:46:28|Pyrotechnic devices are used to separate the forward heat shield - also known as the apex cover - a moment before the drogue chute deployment.
142:46:28|The circular compartment surrounding the docking tunnel holds the landing systems. This includes the two drogue parachutes, the three main parachutes, radio and strobe light beacons, a dye marker, and the three uprighting bags.
142:46:28|The apex cover is jettisoned pyrotechnically. Afterwards, pyrotechnic mortars shoot the drogues and their ropes up into the air above the spacecraft before deployment. Reefers - ropes that prevent the parachute from being deployed completely at once and hence possibly be damaged - are used for the eight seconds, after which pyrotechnic cutters cut these holding ropes and they are allowed to open completely.
142:48:53|Noun 67 displays their range to go to their landing target, as well as their latitude and longitude. It would be the last thing displayed by Program 67 - "Entry - Final Phase". Once their chutes open, guidance is terminated and the computer goes dormant, its mission over.
142:50:06|At 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) the pilot chutes are deployed. They are little parachutes that are used to pull open the main chutes. The drogue chutes are released at the same time. Reefing ropes prevent the main chutes from opening fully for the first 8 seconds, after which they are allowed to fully inflate for the final braking of their landing.
142:54:49|Gerry Griffin has raised his hand in a victorious thumbs up, next to Gene Kranz and and a beaming, applauding Glynn Lunney.
142:55:12|<b>END OF AIR TO GROUND TECHNICAL TRANSCRIPTION</b>
142:55:12|The remaining radio traffic and exchanges are provided via the PAO loop transcript that contained additional post-splashdown material.
142:55:26|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;The last thing that slipped out was the main chute after cold soaking for that time. After that, Fred fell asleep.&quot;
142:55:26|Stable 1 means that the Command Module is floating upright. Stable 2 would mean that a wave or a gust of wind on the parachutes has toppled them upside down. This occurred multiple times during the Apollo landings. A switch was pressed to cut the parachute ropes right after landing to prevent this, but it was not always on time.
142:55:43|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;The impact was as designed because the sea state was slow and we knifed in. It was less impact than Apollo 8 and we stayed stable I. Fred cut in on two circuit breakers and Jack jettisoned the chutes.&quot;
142:55:43|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;I think I only had one in at the time he hit the button, but that's all it takes.&quot;
142:55:43|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Everything worked exactly like the checklist worked.&quot;
142:55:43|<b>Swigert, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;We just went right down the checklist, item by item.&quot;
142:55:43|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;The only thing we forgot to do - I guess I forgot to punch to get lat-long out of the computer.&quot;
142:55:43|<b>Haise, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;The last time I saw, we had miss distance of 0.8 mile. the choppers asked us if we had lat-long laid out and at the time, we didn't have. It might be of interest to point out that, after we hit and had gone through this smoke and entry, we were all three sitting there on the couches, laying in that 81-degree water, blowing frosty smoke out of our mouths. It was still icy cold in the CM.&quot;
142:56:50|The recovery strobe beacon has activated automatically.
143:03:36|It is important for the rescue units to know whether the remaining Command Module RCS fuel has been dumped overboard. Should fuel remain in the system, they might be exposed to these extremely toxic substances while approaching the spacecraft after landing.
143:05:28|The sea anchor will prevent the Command Module from drifting excessively. This will make all subsequent rescue efforts easier.
143:07:40|An inflatable flotation collar is attached by the rescue swimmers onto the circumference of the Command Module. It will provide extra security and stabilization during the crew recovery.
143:14:55|A specially designed inflatable raft is filled and attached to the flotation collar, to stand by to receive the crew from inside the Command Module.
143:19:14|The Command Module side hatch can be opened from the outside, as well as the inside.
143:20:02|The crew has been given some life jackets to wear. The normal recovery procedure would include the swimmer passing them flight suits and filtration masks to wear to prevent contamination of the recovery crew before the crew is transferred to the Mobile Quarantine Facility onboard the carrier. This is of course not needed now.
143:25:32|Sickly Fred gets the first ride off the sea and into the safety of the helicopter.
143:30:20|<b>Lovell, from <span class="attribution">1970 Technical debrief:</span></b> &quot;Egress was good and we had a good crew pickup.&quot;
143:33:10|This remarkable comment reveals the lengths taken to welcome the crew home - to allow them to get dressed for the occasion! The normal recovery plan would have had them get dressed in the Command Module before leaving it for the egress raft.
143:39:24|The crew steps out wearing bespoke flight suits that are adorned with NASA and Apollo 13 patches, as well as custom caps with their names. The Iwo Jima, being the primary recovery ship, would have been carrying these articles of clothing for them to wear for the landing.
